    text: YOUR CARING ENDODONTIST IN HOUSTON, TX
    content: 
      Dr. Erin Loggins, DDS was raised in West Columbia, TX and has an unwavering passion for dental care that has stayed with her for her entire adult life. She got her start in dentistry by working at her local dental office the summer before attending Texas A&M University, where she earned her Biomedical Science degree. She then received her DDS from the University of Texas – Health Science Center in San Antonio.

      As a licensed and board-eligible dentist in the state of Texas, she is determined to give her patients the best possible care. After 6 years of general dentistry, she continued her training in an endodontic specialty program and received her endodontics certificate at the VA Hospital in Long Beach, CA in 2015.

      With over a decade of experience, Dr. Loggins’s goal is to provide quality care and a comfortable environment for patients. Her patients’ health and happiness are her top priority. She has done extensive research into regenerative endodontics because she wants their smiles to shine without fail. When she isn't at the office, Dr. Loggins enjoys live music, college football, and spending time with her family and two rescue dogs, Barney and Jolie!
