    heading: WHAT IS A DENTAL EMERGENCY?
    text: NU DENTISTRY MAKES SURE YOU NEVER PUT OFF A NECESSARY PROCEDURE.
    content: |-
      It can be hard to tell sometimes whether something is truly an 'emergency.' Do you need immediate treatment, or can it wait until you schedule an appointment? If you experience any of these symptoms, please call our office at (832) 916-4144:

      - **Oral sensitivity.** Although minor sensitivity can be addressed at a regular appointment, a sudden onset of severe sensitivity may indicate infection.
      - **Severe tooth, gum, or jaw pain.** Acute pain can indicate multiple dental issues. Toothaches are a sign of infection, especially when accompanied by a fever, earache, or pressure.
      - **Broken or chipped tooth.** These injuries need immediate evaluation to keep from getting infected. Jagged teeth edges can also cause sores and abrasions in the mouth.
      - **Knocked out tooth.** If you're missing a tooth, treatment should be received as soon as possible. For the tooth's best chance of survival, gather as many pieces as possible and only pick up the tooth by the crown, never the root.
      - **Dislodged or loose tooth.** Loose teeth in adults are a sign of either tooth injury or infection.
      - **Tooth abscess.** When a tooth infection becomes bad enough, the tooth swells and develops a pocket of pus known as an abscess. They're very serious and can spread to other areas of your jaw, head, and neck if left untreated.
      - **Decay and cavities.** If you're in extreme pain and know you have tooth decay or a cavity, please call our office so we can halt or treat any possible infections.
      - **Excessive bleeding gums.** A little bit of blood after flossing or a dental exam is typical. It can be a sign of gingivitis or early **periodontal disease**. However, if the gums won't stop bleeding, this may indicate a severe injury or advanced gum disease.

    heading: DO I NEED A TOOTH EXTRACTION?
    text: WE MAKE SURE YOU’RE ALWAYS PREPARED, EVEN WITH SERIOUS PROCEDURES.
    content: |-
      At Nu Dentistry, we do our best to save your teeth, but that's not always possible. Sometimes a tooth has decayed too much or fractured too severely for repairs like fillings, root canals, and frequent deep cleanings to be an option. Other times, extra or crowded teeth block emerging teeth from coming out without ruining the alignment of your arch. During cases like these, the best option to protect the teeth and bone around it is to have the tooth extracted. There are two kinds of extractions: a simple extraction and a surgical extraction. Simple extractions are for teeth visible above the gum line, and they can be done by loosening the tooth with an elevator tool and removing it with forceps.

      Surgical extractions are done on teeth either broken beneath or un-emerged from the gums. This type requires an incision into the gums to entirely remove the submerged tooth. While this procedure may seem scary at first, our dentists make sure that your operation is virtually painless. We offer multiple anesthetic and sedation options, guaranteeing that you're always comfortable during your treatment. We offer many services, such as implants, dentures, and bridges, that can help fill the gap and restore your missing tooth. We want to make sure you're always happy with your smile.

      - heading: IS A CRACKED TOOTH AN EMERGENCY?
        content:
          A cracked tooth is only an emergency if it is extremely painful. Pain can be a sign that the inside is damaged and the tooth fractured. If a tooth is fractured badly enough, it may not be salvageable. If these symptoms apply to you, please contact us immediately.
      - heading: WHEN SHOULD A TOOTH BE REMOVED?
        content:
          A dentist must pull the tooth to stop the spread of infection. A tooth might also need extraction if teeth are overcrowded or incoming teeth are impacted and unable to emerge. Overcrowding often happens with incoming wisdom teeth.
      - heading: HOW DO DENTISTS TREAT GINGIVITIS?
        content:
          Gingivitis occurs when plaque and tartar build-up around and under the gums, causing infection. Depending on the severity, treatment will include a regular dental cleaning or deep cleaning. A deep cleaning involves scaling teeth clean both above and below the gumline, respectively, of hardened build-up. Periodontal disease must be treated with deep cleaning. 
      - heading: ARE YOU SEDATED FOR A ROOT CANAL?
        content:
          While only local anesthesia is necessary when performing a root canal, you can opt for sedation with the procedure on request. Our fully trained dentists can sedate you during the procedure, either with oral conscious sedation or IV sedation. For anxious patients, this can soothe nervousness and give the best possible treatment experience.        
      - heading: SHOULD I SAVE MY TOOTH OR PULL IT?
        content:
          We always do our best to save our patients' teeth because natural teeth are stronger and keep their neighbors from shifting. Keeping those teeth will save a lot of time, discomfort, and money in the long run. However, there are times when a tooth has fractured or decayed past the point of saving, even with a root canal, and an extraction is necessary.
      - heading: WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU NEVER GET YOUR WISDOM TEETH PULLED OUT?
        content:
          Wisdom teeth are often extracted when they either don't fully emerge from the gum or if they stay fully submerged. Keeping your wisdom teeth in these circumstances can lead to infection or the development of oral cysts, which can damage your gums and bone.
