    heading: DO I NEED A ROOT CANAL?
    text: A TIMELY ROOT CANAL IN HOUSTON, TX COULD SAVE YOUR TOOTH
    content: |-
      When it comes to saving a tooth, time is always crucial. Being able to recognize warning signs early can be the deciding factor on whether your tooth's damage is too extensive for a root canal to be done. When it comes to **dental emergencies**, we always want to ensure you receive the treatment that best preserves your dental health.

      Some symptoms and signs that you might need a root canal include:

      - **Loose tooth.** When the root of a tooth becomes infected, it can kill the nerve and weaken the surrounding enamel, causing it to lose its stability.
      - **Swollen gums.** The infection of the tooth may lead to contamination of the surrounding gums. The swelling might come and go, or your gums may have a white pimple on it, known as an abscess. Abscesses sometimes ooze pus.
      - **Chipped or cracked tooth.** When a tooth chips or cracks, it can damage the nerve and leave the root exposed to potential bacteria and infection.
      - **Dark tooth discoloration.** A tooth may become grey or blackened when the underlying roots and nerves are damaged.
      - **Persistent tooth pain.** A deeply infected tooth and its surrounding neighbors and bone may hurt all the time or reoccur in waves. While this may not always be the fault of a root canal infection, you should always see your dentist if you have constant toothaches or pain.
      - **Temperature sensitivity.** A root canal infection can make enjoying hot and cold food and drinks painful. The discomfort can either be a sharp, severe pain or a persistent, dull ache.
      - Please note that this is not a comprehensive list, and sometimes there are no symptoms present. It's important to speak with your dentist to diagnose whether you need a root canal. If you believe you may need a root canal, call our office at (832) 916-4144 to schedule a consultation.

    heading: WHAT IS A ROOT CANAL?
    text: HERE'S EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR ROOT CANAL PROCEDURE
    content: |-
      Sometimes a tooth becomes so infected, inflamed, or decayed that its soft, inner pulp and nerves become permanently damaged. When this happens, your dentist may recommend you receive a root canal to clear out the decay, disinfect the tooth, fill it, and seal it to save what’s left of the tooth. A root canal is the tried and true method of removing a dental infection while saving the tooth. A root canal usually requires two visits. During the first visit, the root canal is performed.

      Your endodontist will remove the infected pulp and clean the tooth before sealing with a temporary filling. Once the tooth has healed, your tooth will be permanently filled and sealed. While the outer enamel will remain untouched, your original tooth will be vulnerable and weak without its pulp. In many cases, the endodontist will surround your original tooth with a crown to protect it from being vulnerable and weak. Post root canal sensitivity is common but will usually subside within a short period of time.

      You will be given instructions for proper care after your appointments.Also, regular dental hygiene and dental visits are imperative to extend the length of your root canal treatment and overall dental health. A root canal is often the last defense in preserving a tooth. If the decay is too severe for a root canal procedure to be done, your dentist may suggest that the tooth be removed to prevent further infection or complications. Let us get you out of pain. Give us a call today.

      - heading: DO ROOT CANALS HURT?
        content:
          Thanks to modern technology, anesthesia, and sedation methods your procedure can be relatively painless. Your tooth and the surrounding area will be completely numb throughout your treatment. At Nu Dentistry, we pride ourselves on keeping our patients comfortable and relaxed, even during intensive procedures.
      - heading: HOW MUCH DOES A ROOT CANAL COST?
        content:
          A root canal's price depends on several factors, including the severity of the cavity, the location of the tooth, and the number of roots to be cleared and filled. If a crown is needed, the additional costs may vary depending on the materials used, such as porcelain, ceramic, or metal. We offer many financial options that can be discussed during your consultation.
      - heading: DO I NEED A CROWN AFTER A ROOT CANAL?
        content:
          Not all root canals require a crown, but they do need to be reinforced. Your tooth will be weaker following treatment, so your dentist or endodontist may highly recommend that you receive a crown to protect your tooth, especially if it's a molar or premolar. The placement of a crown will extend the natural life of your tooth, which is always the goal of dentistry.
      - heading: HOW LONG DOES A ROOT CANAL TAKE?
        content:
          A simple root canal treatment can take between 30 to 90 minutes, depending on the tooth. Molars can take longer as up to 4 root canals will be needed to remove and fill each root. A second visit may be necessary to fully seal the tooth and cap it with either a crown or filling.      
      - heading: SHOULD I GET A ROOT CANAL OR EXTRACTION?
        content:
          While some patients choose to get an extraction when a root canal is still possible, we always recommend that you get a root canal if you can. Root canals can save the tooth by clearing out infections. Tooth extractions, however, should only be done if the damage to the tooth is so severe that there is no way to save it. Your dentist will discuss which options are available to you.
      - heading: DO I NEED A ROOT CANAL IF THERE IS NO PAIN?
        content:
          Contrary to popular belief, not all infected teeth hurt. A lack of pain does not always mean that a root canal should be put off or avoided. Even in the absence of pain, the damage may worsen with time until the tooth can no longer be saved. If your dentist or endodontist recommends a root canal, you should listen to them as it will save you a lot of time, money, and pain in the long run.
