    heading: "What Are Veneers?"
    text: Porcelain veneers in Bellflower can be your cosmetic dentistry solution
    content: Veneers are a type of cosmetic dentistry* which helps with the appearance of your already-present teeth. Veneers, or tooth laminates, are offered in two types of materials, resin or porcelain. Porcelain veneers in Bellflower look like and match your natural teeth. When choosing porcelain over resin, you get a more natural look, but there is also some removal of the natural tooth required. However, with resin, that isn’t the case. Resin veneers do not possess as natural of a look as porcelain, but the material is thin enough to not require removal of some of the natural tooth. If you want to take your pearly whites to the next level with porcelain veneers in Bellflower, call us to schedule an appointment.

    heading: Porcelain Veneers and Why You May Want Them
    text: Tooth veneers in Bellflower are very popular, and here is why
    content:
      Tooth veneers are a common cosmetic solution to several different dental problems, including the most common of which is discoloration of the teeth. Discoloration of your teeth can be caused by several factors such as smoking, drinking coffee or other dark beverages, eating berries or colored foods, and more. Some even have naturally yellow teeth, and porcelain veneers in Bellflower can help in this case as well. Tooth veneers will give you an instant brighter and whiter smile upgrade, which will last a long time. However, discoloration isn’t the only issue veneers can solve. If you have misshapen teeth, porcelain veneers can help correct thin, worn down, and chipped teeth. Lastly, many with gaps in their teeth forgo orthodontics* and instead use porcelain veneers to fill in the gap by making other teeth appear larger. If you are experiencing any of these cosmetic issues with your smile, tooth veneers in Bellflower may be for you. Call us today to set up your consultation.

    faqs:
      - heading: What are veneers made of?
        content:
          Dental veneers are thin shells that are bonded to the front of teeth and serve as an alternative to a tooth-colored filling. Veneers can be made from a variety of materials, including porcelain, composite resin, or plastic. The material used depends on your needs and preference for appearance.
      - heading: How can I correct my smile?
        content:
          Veneers are an easy way to fix a crooked, chipped, or misshapen tooth. They can also be used to correct teeth that are too small for the mouth. Veneer dentistry will give you back your confidence with a perfect smile! 
      - heading: How do veneers work?
        content:
          A beautiful smile is the key to a good first impression and an unforgettable personality. Many people don't realize that there are many benefits to getting cosmetic dentistry done, such as an improved social life, increased self-confidence, improved mood, and better communication skills.
      - heading: Are veneers safe long term?
        content:
          Yes! There's no specific limit as to how long you can keep them in, but it is important to maintain these cosmetic enhancements by visiting your dentist on a regular basis for checkups and cleanings; this will help ensure their longevity.
      - heading: Who is a good candidate for veneers?
        content:
          "Here is a list of the top five people who may benefit from getting dental veneers done: people with gaps between their teeth, those whose teeth have become discolored due to age or smoking, those who don't like how their smile looks when they open their mouth wide for photos, people who feel self-conscious about having braces on all their teeth at once, and anyone else that wants an instant perfect smile."
      - heading: How do you prepare for veneers?
        content:
          Dental veneers are a common and great way to enhance the appearance of teeth. While there is no set preparation for dental veneers, it is important to have a few appointments before you get your final results.
      - heading: Can you take veneers off?
        content:
          Dental veneers are bonded to the tooth surface for a strong hold and should only be removed by a dentist. 
      - heading: What is the best color for veneers?
        content:
          Dental veneers transform the appearance of your smile and are one of the most sought-after cosmetic procedures. People often wonder what color dental veneers should be. Dental veneers have so many options to choose from, so your final decision will largely be influenced by your personal preferences.
      - heading: Are veneers high maintenance?
        content:
          The truth is that they're not high maintenance at all, you just need to take care of them with brushing and flossing like your natural teeth. Veneers are designed so they don't require the same type of attention as natural teeth do, but we still want people wearing them to take care of their oral health.
