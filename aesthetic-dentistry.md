    heading: Can Cosmetic Dentistry Improve Your Health?
    text: Our cosmetic dentist in Bellflower encourages cosmetic procedures for their health benefits
    content:
      One of the best benefits to any type of cosmetic dentistry procedure may not be that it makes your smile more aesthetically pleasing, but it can also improve your overall health. Braces, clear or metal, can straighten your teeth while making it easier for you to floss and take care of your dental health down the road. This also includes Invisalign. If you have damaged, broken, cracked, chipped, or decaying teeth, cosmetic dentistry can reduce the chance of you having further decay or problems with your beautiful teeth in the future. You also get the benefit of having a full set of perfect teeth. Another advantage of cosmetic dentistry is helping with the reduction of grinding your teeth. This happens most often when teeth are misaligned, which can be fixed by Invisalign or braces. Without grinding your teeth, they will ultimately last longer and stay strong. If you are ready to take your smile to the next step by letting our cosmetic dentist in Bellflower enhance your beautiful smile, schedule an appointment with us today by calling us.

      - heading: What is cosmetic dentistry?
        content:
          Cosmetic dentistry is a term used to describe a variety of dental procedures that are intended to improve the appearance of your teeth and smile. Cosmetic dentists use their skills in cosmetic dentistry for several reasons, including improving the overall look of one's teeth, closing spaces between teeth, changing bite alignment or correcting misaligned bites, covering stains from smoking or drinking coffee/tea, removing excess gum tissue in order to expose more tooth surface area, and various other treatments that help patients feel better about themselves when they look in the mirror.
      - heading: What type of dentist does cosmetic dentistry?
        content:
          A dentist who specializes in cosmetic dentistry is trained to provide you with the perfect smile. Bellflower Dental Group's cosmetic dentists can help you out with everything from whitening your teeth or fixing a chipped tooth to straightening crooked teeth. They are also educated on how to improve the appearance of your mouth by making it more proportionate and attractive. 
      - heading: What are the benefits of cosmetic dentistry?
        content:
          A beautiful smile is the key to a good first impression and an unforgettable personality. Many people don't realize that there are many benefits to getting cosmetic dentistry done, such as an improved social life, increased self-confidence, improved mood, and better communication skills.
      - heading: What does cosmetic dentistry include?
        content:
          Cosmetic dentistry can include things like teeth whitening and veneers. Dentures and crowns may also be included under cosmetic dentistry when they are needed for restoring function or appearance after trauma such as a broken tooth.
      - heading: What is cosmetic teeth whitening?
        content:
          Cosmetic teeth whitening is a process that removes the stains from your teeth and makes them whiter. Your dentist will take an impression of your teeth to create a custom tray for your mouth, which can be used in-office or at home. You will wear this tray for 20 minutes before removing it and brushing out the gel residue with water only. 
      - heading: How do veneers work?
        content:
          Veneers are thin pieces of tooth-colored porcelain that are put on top of the teeth to change the shape, color, or length. Porcelain veneers can be used for many reasons, including hiding stains and discoloration. Veneers also help people who have crooked teeth or gaps between their teeth. They can even give you a whole new smile! It is important to remember that this treatment will not last forever, so it's important to maintain them by brushing twice daily with toothpaste and flossing once a day to get rid of bacteria, which helps keep your veneer looking beautiful!
      - heading: Is dental bonding permanent?
        content:
          Yes, dental bonding is permanent. Dental bonding is a tooth-colored material that can be used to restore decayed or damaged teeth. The material adheres to the tooth's surface and hardens when exposed to ultraviolet light in a dentist’s office. A denture may also be made with this material by shaping it into a mold of the patient’s mouth with their natural teeth removed.
      - heading: What are the main differences between Lumineers and veneers?
        content:
          The main differences between Lumineers and veneers are the material, cost, and placement. A veneer is made of porcelain which is then put on top of your teeth to replace one or more damaged ones. It can also be used to cover up a tooth that has been stained. Another difference between the two is how they're placed in your mouth. The process for placing a Lumineer starts with an impression being taken by the dentist, whereas veneers are created in a lab before they're bonded onto your teeth. 
      - heading: Which last longer, veneers or Lumineers?
        content:
          Both veneer and Lumineer treatments require pre-treatment before the process begins, which includes taking impressions to make a mold for the new tooth. The difference between these two is how long they last; veneers will last about 10 years, while Lumineers will last up to 15 years.
