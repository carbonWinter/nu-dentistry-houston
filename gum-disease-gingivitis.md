    heading: Gum Disease and Deep Cleanings
    text: If your gingivitis in Bellflower is caught early, it may be reversible
    content: Harmful bacteria in your mouth are the most common cause of gum disease. If you are having problems with your gums, such as swelling, bleeding, or infection, those are signs of gingivitis or gum disease. If you are in the developing stages of gum disease in Bellflower, our doctors will suggest a deep cleaning. Often people think of a deep cleaning like a routine teeth cleaning*, but it is actually quite different. A deep cleaning helps get rid of the harmful bacteria, which could potentially affect your jawbone and other support for your teeth, causing you to lose them. Often deep cleanings are separated into a couple of visits in order to clean the affected areas with detail. Because a deep cleaning involves removing tartar below the gum line, it is a completely different approach when compared to regular cleanings. Schedule your appointment with us today or call us for more information on gum disease in Bellflower.

    heading: Symptoms and Severity of Gingivitis
    text: Learn what to look for as signs of gingivitis in Bellflower
    content:
      So how do you know if you have gum disease? You won’t be able to know for sure until our dental professionals at Bellflower Dental Group examine you, however, there are some clear symptoms you should look out for. Classic symptoms include frequent bleeding, swelling, and tenderness of the gums. Also, you may notice your gums are red and tender, and sometimes your gums will recede from your teeth. Another common symptom is bad breath. The bad breath is caused by pockets which may form between your teeth and gums, as that is where food can collect in your mouth. When and if these pockets form, you should seek professional help immediately. Gingivitis can lead to significant problems such as bone loss and losing your teeth. Luckily if you are in the early stages of gum disease, it can be reversed. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms of gingivitis in Bellflower, please give us a call. We want to help you keep your beautiful pearly whites healthy.

    faqs:
      - heading: What is the main cause of gingivitis?
        content:
          Gingivitis is an acute form of gum disease that can be caused by many factors, but the main cause of gingivitis is plaque. Plaque is a sticky film which forms on teeth and contains bacteria. These bacteria are responsible for the irritation and inflammation of the gums. If left untreated, this inflammation may lead to periodontal disease, which has more serious consequences than just bad breath! 
      - heading: How do dentists treat gingivitis?
        content:
          Gingivitis can be prevented with proper brushing, flossing, and dental hygiene practices. Dentists often treat gingivitis with antibiotics or mouthwashes to fight off infection and help control pain levels. 
      - heading: Does laser treatment for gum disease work?
        content:
          Laser treatment has been proven to be effective in the treatment of gum diseases and periodontal disease, with some studies showing that it can reduce inflammation by up to 50%. In addition, laser therapy is also more cost-effective than traditional treatments because it requires fewer visits.
      - heading: What can gum disease lead to?
        content:
          Gum disease can lead to many other health problems. Gum disease is inflammation of the gums and will destroy teeth*, cause bad breath, tooth loss, infections in the bone around your teeth, and may even lead to heart attacks or strokes.
      - heading: What is the best treatment for gingivitis?
        content:
          The most common form of treatment for it is brushing and flossing twice per day, as well as getting regular dental check-ups. However, there are other treatments, such as antibiotics that may be prescribed by your dentist or doctor. Sterilizing toothbrushes can also help reduce bacteria levels in the mouth. 
      - heading: How do I know if my gingivitis is getting better?
        content:
          There's a good chance that your gingivitis symptoms are improving if the inflammation has reduced significantly and bleeding has decreased by 75 percent when brushing or flossing. If you notice tartar accumulating again on your teeth surfaces where it was regularly removed, this may indicate that the severity of your gingivitis symptoms has improved. Finally, if your bad breath has decreased, your gingivitis symptoms have drastically improved.    
      - heading: Is it painful to get a deep cleaning at the dentist?
        content:
          There is a perception that it is painful and unpleasant, but in reality, most dental treatments are painless. When you go for a deep cleaning at your local dentist office, they use anesthesia to numb the area so you don't feel anything. The only time there might be some discomfort would be when they use metal instruments on teeth with decay or gum disease.         
      - heading: What are periodontal procedures?
        content:
          While there are several types of periodontal treatment including scaling and root planing, soft tissue surgery is one of the most popular procedures because it can help reduce bleeding gums and pockets around teeth, which can prevent harmful bacteria from building up between your teeth or below your gum line.          
      - heading: What are some of the early warning signs of gum disease?
        content:
          "You may be suffering from periodontal disease if you experience any of the following symptoms: bleeding gums, swollen gums, persistent bad breath, a foul taste in your mouth, and loose teeth. If you suspect you have this condition, see your dentist, as it will cause a lot more damage and pain if left untreated."
