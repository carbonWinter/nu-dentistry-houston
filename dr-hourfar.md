    content: 
      Dr. Alireza Hourfar, DDS is a board-certified orthodontist with many years of professional experience under his belt. He has been a practicing orthodontist since 2004, and he continues to use his expertise to help patients achieve their dream smile. He is a proud graduate of the University of California Los Angeles.

      Dr. Hourfar moved to the US after being accepted into the UCLA orthodontics program, using this opportunity to expand his professional horizons and fulfill his yearning for a dynamic career. From 2004 to 2010, Dr. Hourfar successfully ran his own orthodontics practice while also volunteering locally to help raise awareness about preventative dental measures to areas in need. Since his move to Houston in 2015, he has worked diligently to bring high-quality orthodontics all over the general Houston metropolitan area across numerous dental practices.

      He is excited to work with the Nu Dentistry team to help our patients correct their smiles into their straightest and healthiest selves. Dr. Hourfar is a proud part of the growing Aliana community together with his wife and three amazing kids. He looks forward to seeing you (and your smile) at Nu Dentistry!
