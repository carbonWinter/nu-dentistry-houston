    faqs:
      - heading: What is dental conscious sedation?
        content:
          Dental conscious sedation is the use of medications to reduce anxiety and decrease pain for patients before dental procedures. It can be used in children, adults, or seniors who are apprehensive about their dental treatments. 
      - heading: How does sleep dentistry work?
        content:
          Sedation dentistry helps patients stay calm during their visits so they do not panic or become anxious when receiving care from a dentist. Sedatives are administered through different methods depending on what type of sedation is needed.
      - heading: What do dentists use to sedate you?
        content:
          Anesthesia is a medication that allows the patient to be unconscious during surgery. The most common type of anesthesia used by dentists is nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas. Dentists use it because it's inexpensive and easy to administer. Nitrous oxide works by blocking pain signals from reaching your brain and slowing down your breathing so you don't feel as much discomfort. It can take some time for the effects to kick in, but once they do, you'll start feeling lightheaded and woozy right away.
      - heading: Do you feel pain with oral sedation?
        content:
          No, you should feel no pain. Oral sedatives are prescribed by dentists in order for patients to relax and receive dental care. These medications can be taken in pill form or placed under the tongue (sublingual) and work very quickly after ingestion. If you experience any type of physical discomfort while taking a medication that was designed to relieve anxiety or pain during dental procedures, tell your dentist immediately.
      - heading: Is sedation dentistry dangerous?
        content:
          Sedation enlists the help of different chemicals to decrease anxiety and create an environment where you feel comfortable while getting your dental work done. It can be scary thinking about how these chemicals could affect your body, but rest assured - if done correctly by trained professionals, there is no risk for serious side effects.
      - heading: How long does dental sedation last?
        content:
          The duration of your dental sedation is largely dependent on the specific drug that is used during treatment. One possible consideration is midazolam, which tends to wear off in about 60 minutes or less once it has been injected into your bloodstream.
      - heading: What are the side effects of sedation?
        content:
          There are many side effects of sedation. The most common include feeling groggy, tired, or sleepy after treatment is complete. There may also be problems with coordination and balance for a short time afterward. 
      - heading: How safe is sedation dentistry?
        content:
          Sedation dentistry allows patients to get all the benefits of seeing their dentist regularly while still being able to control how much discomfort is involved. While there are some risks associated with conscious sedation, it's important to note that these risks are extremely rare and you should not let your fears keep you from getting dental work done.
      - heading: What can I expect after sedation dentistry?
        content:
          After your procedure, it's important to have someone else driving home. You should also wait 4 hours after surgery before consuming alcohol or taking sleeping pills. Your doctor will provide instructions for how long you need to wait before resuming normal activities like brushing your teeth, working out, or returning to work.
