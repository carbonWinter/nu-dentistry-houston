    heading: "The Root Canal Process: No More Pain"
    text: Endodontics in Bellflower can take away your pain in no time
    content:
      At Bellflower Dental Group, we know that hearing you need a root canal can be a little unsettling, especially if you have not experienced a dental procedure before. The best thing to remember when preparing for this procedure is that its purpose is to get you out of pain, rather than causing it. To help ease your mind, we thought it would be helpful to give you some of the details of the root canal process. Root canals, or endodontic treatment, are used whenever the pulp of a tooth becomes infected from tooth decay. The pulp of your teeth is where you will find the nerves. When the pulp becomes infected, a root canal is used to clean out the infected area and replace it. The purpose of endodontics in Bellflower is to save your tooth, and we will always try to save your tooth before suggesting a tooth extraction*. If you do receive root canal treatment, it is likely you may need another procedure such as a dental crown** or other restoration to keep the tooth safe. Schedule your consultation and examination today for a root canal in Bellflower. The quicker we can get you out of pain, the better!

    faqs:
      - heading: Should I get a root canal or extraction?
        content:
          A root canal is a dental procedure to remove the infected pulp and nerve of a tooth. An extraction is an operation to remove a tooth from your mouth and may be required if the tooth has excessive decay, damage, or infection. A dentist will examine your teeth with X-rays to determine which treatment you need.
      - heading: Is a root canal painful?
        content:
          If you've been told that a root canal is painful, you should know that it's not as bad as it sounds. The procedure can be uncomfortable and may cause some pain, but most patients report feeling relief after seeing the dentist. In fact, many people have reported being pleasantly surprised by how easy going through with a root canal actually was! 
      - heading: What happens during a root canal?
        content:
          During a root canal, the nerve and pulp tissue inside your tooth is removed. It can be performed on one or more teeth, depending on the severity of the infection. Root canal therapy is done to save your natural tooth as an extraction may not be desirable for everyone, especially those with limited space in their mouth due to overcrowding, lack of bone height, or other factors. The dentist will numb up the area around the tooth and remove any decay from it before removing all infected material from within the tooth and filling it with a rubber-like substance called gutta percha. Once this step has been completed, they will place a crown over the top of your tooth, which restores its function and appearance!
      - heading: What is an endodontist in dentistry?
        content:
          Endodontists are dentists who provide care for the teeth and gums, but they specialize in more specific areas of dental care. These specialists can assist you with many procedures, including root canal treatment and gum disease treatments. They can also help to diagnose any oral health problems you may be experiencing, such as infections or even tumors of the jawbone. 
      - heading: What procedures does an endodontist perform?
        content:
          An endodontist is a dentist who specializes in the treatment of tooth-related diseases and conditions. They can treat dental caries (tooth decay), pulpitis (inflammation of the pulp), and other problems like root canal therapy, crown lengthening, periodontal disease, and apical surgery. The procedures they perform vary depending on what area of dentistry they specialize in.
      - heading: How long does a root canal take to heal?
        content:
          A root canal procedure can take anywhere from two weeks to three months to complete and will depend on the severity of your tooth's infection. The length of time it takes for a root canal to heal also depends on how well you care for the site after treatment.
      - heading: Do I need a crown after a root canal?
        content:
          After a root canal treatment, some patients will need to have crown work done after the post-treatment healing period; this includes those who had their teeth crowned before they needed a root canal. Others may not need anything more than extraction if there was extensive decay in the tooth and no significant nerve damage during treatment. Talk to your dentist about what's best for you!
      - heading: Can I drive home after a root canal?
        content:
          Before you leave the dentist's office after a root canal, it is important to know what to expect. In some cases, you may be given anesthetic gas or nitrous oxide, which will make driving dangerous as well as illegal. If you are unsure about whether or not to drive yourself home from the appointment, then ask your dentist before leaving. 
      - heading: How long does a root canal take to complete?
        content:
          The root canal treatment itself will typically take about 90 minutes. Teeth with multiple canals or with an infection present may take more than one appointment.
