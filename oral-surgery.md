    text: Many common procedures fall under the label of oral surgery, including extractions, implants, and gum treatments
    content: Dental oral surgery is an integral part of a dental practice. This type of dental surgery involves aesthetic modification or reconstruction of the skin, mucosa, bones, jaws, teeth, and gingiva of the mouth. Dental surgeons may also specialize in orthognathic surgery including corrective jaw surgeries. These oral surgeries can range from dental extractions when a tooth is impacted to dental implants where a bone graft may be needed.

While many dentists perform gum surgeries as part of their practice, some gum specialists go beyond gum disease treatment and perform gum reconstruction, gum transplants, and gum augmentation."

    heading: Be Smart When It Comes To Wisdom Teeth
    text: Your tooth extraction can be simple or surgical, luckily, we perform both
    content:
      "Wisdom tooth removal is the common name for surgical removal of the third molars or wisdom teeth. Wisdom tooth extraction may be recommended when there is not enough space available in the mouth for normal tooth eruption or tooth impaction occurs. It can also alleviate symptoms caused by infection. The process usually involves numbing the tooth, tooth roots, and the surrounding gums then removing the tooth with a forceps. However, if the tooth is impacted or has atypical roots, oral surgery may be necessary. \n\n

      A surgical extraction is more involved than your typical tooth removal. The oral surgeon will make an incision in your gum line, creating flaps to expose the tooth and the surrounding bone area. Any bone that prevents access to the tooth will be removed before the dental surgeon divides the tooth into sections, making it easier to extract. The dentist removes the tooth and clears away any remaining debris from around the gumline or the bone. The wound is then stitched up. The dentist applies gauze to the extraction site to control any extra bleeding and help with clotting.\n\n

      It is common for people to feel pain after tooth removal while some experience mild discomfort, but it will eventually get better within a few days. After tooth removal, pain medications and antibiotics should be taken as directed by your dentist to avoid swelling and irritation caused by the tooth extraction."
