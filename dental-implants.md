    text: GET YOUR BEAUTIFUL SMILE BACK WITH THE NU DENTISTRY TEAM
    content: |-
      There are many different options on the market when it comes to restoring a missing tooth, each with their own advantages. At Nu Dentistry, we believe that dental implants are the best option over any other alternatives, including traditional dental bridges and dentures.

      Dental implants are posts, either titanium or zirconia, surgically secured into the jawbone under your gums, attached by an abutment to a crown. There are three parts to the dental implant procedure:

      - **Implant.** This is the screw or post that is implanted into your jawbone to act as a replacement for your missing root. This screw is most commonly made of titanium or zirconia, but there are other options available.
      - **Abutment.** A piece that attaches to the top of the post, allowing for a restorative device to be attached on top.
      - **Crown.** Finally, a crown is fastened to the abutment to return your smile to its natural look.

      If you’re missing more than one tooth, we also offer implant-supported bridges and dentures that don’t slip in your mouth, making it easier to talk, eat, and live an easier life. They also feel and look more natural, resulting in better overall health and more confidence!

      Please give our staff a call to set up your implant consultation today!

    text: WE ALWAYS KEEP YOU IN THE KNOW, SO YOU MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS POSSIBLE
    content: |-
      Here at Nu Dentistry, we want to make sure you're always more than satisfied with your dental care. Too many times, we've had patients who have had other dentists refer them for treatments that weren't right for them. We know that there are a lot of variables and choices involved when it comes to your dental health. But even when it comes to **dental emergencies**, we're here to help you make informed and educated decisions. There is no age limit when it comes to your dental implant. Patients as old as 85 and 95 have come in to start their new lease on life with their new teeth. To be a good candidate, you should have healthy gums and bone, as well as good overall health. If your jawbone has already deteriorated, we can perform a bone grafting operation to make your implant possible. Excellent oral hygiene is a plus because it will ensure the longevity and success of your implant. We offer a consultation, to begin with, so that we can help you decide if implants are the right choice for you.

        text: |-
          YWhen left alone too long, a tooth extraction or gum disease can deteriorate the jawbone, not leaving enough bone to hold an implant. A bone graft is needed to strengthen the jaw with new bone before the post or screw can be placed.

          Our team will surgically implant the metal post into your jawbone and leave it to heal. We offer a range of anesthesia and sedation options to keep you comfortable and pain-free.

          Your mouth will be given time to heal so that the post fuses to the bone in a process known as osseointegration. This process can take longer, depending on the number of implants.

          Once your jaw has fully healed, an abutment will be attached to the implant, ready to connect to your new teeth. The abutment can sometimes be completed at the same time as the implant.

    heading: THE BENEFITS OF DENTAL IMPLANTS
    text: COUNT ON US TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE DELIGHTED WITH YOUR NEW TEETH
    content: |-
      Dental implants, bridges, and dentures all solve the same problem: replacing a missing tooth. However, implants and implant-supported appliances have some of their own unique benefits. One significant advantage of an implant over a bridge is that the surrounding teeth don't need to be altered to close the gap. Additionally, implants are easier to clean and function more normally than other alternatives. Here are some other fantastic implant perks:

      - **Stabilized denture.** Permanent dentures fixed by implants don't shift in your mouth, even while eating.
      - **Confident speech.** With reliable, strong teeth, you'll have no trouble speaking clearly.
      - **Comfort.** Dental implants can not only look but feel just like regular teeth.
      - **Fewer dietary restrictions.** Add steak, apples, and corn-on-the-cob to your diet, if you'd like!
      - **Avoid jawbone loss or facial sagging.** Implants can retain and grow your jawbone, keeping your mouth in prime health!

    faqs:
      - heading: HOW LONG DOES A DENTAL IMPLANT LAST?
        content:
          Dental implants can last for many years, but there's no exact date for how long. It depends on several factors, such as the implant materials used, the implant's location, and even the patient's diet and dental hygiene habits. An implant with a titanium post and porcelain crown can last 25 years or more if a patient eats well, regularly brushes and flosses their teeth, and regularly attends dental cleanings.
      - heading: IS BONE GRAFTING NECESSARY AFTER TOOTH EXTRACTION?
        content:
          Bone grafting may be necessary if a patient waits too long between their extraction and implant surgeries. Within the first year, without further treatment, the patient can lose enough bone that there is not enough left for a post to be implanted in the jaw.
      - heading: WHO IS A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR DENTAL IMPLANTS?
        content:
          Patients in good dental and overall health are prime candidates for dental implants, running the smallest risk of possible complications. If you have existing health conditions like gum disease, diabetes, or cancer, you are likely still a good candidate for implants. These conditions, however, should be discussed with your dentist or periodontist.
      - heading: HOW MUCH ARE DENTAL IMPLANTS?
        content:
          Depending on your needs and how many teeth replaced, the cost of your new teeth can vary. However, we want to ensure you always receive affordable dental implants. We'll work with you and your insurance, if you have it, to develop a payment plan and method that works best for you.    
      - heading: DO DENTAL IMPLANTS LOOK LIKE REAL TEETH?
        content:
          Our dentists are experts when it comes to this procedure, and we make sure that your implants look just as natural as your real teeth. We take your new teeth’s color, shape, and size into account so that no one can pick them out in a lineup.
      - heading: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN IMPLANT AND A BRIDGE?
        content:
          While having the same purpose, implants and bridges have a significant difference. A dental bridge replaces a missing tooth by cementing the replacement to its two neighbors with crowns, which can cause undue strain on the attached teeth. Implants, however, are one or more teeth inserted directly into the patient's jaw, requiring surgery. While bridges need neighboring teeth to be effective, implants do not. It is also possible to receive full-mouth dental implants, such as with All-on-4 dental implants.
      - heading: ARE DENTAL IMPLANTS REMOVABLE OR DO THEY STAY IN YOUR MOUTH?
        content:
          Implants are directly attached to your jawbone, meaning they are not removable. However, there are implant-supported appliances such as dentures, which can be taken out. Our dentists will discuss with you the advantages of each so you can decide which is right for you.
      - heading: WHAT ARE MINI DENTAL IMPLANTS?
        content:
          Mini dental implants use much smaller posts than traditional implants. Their size allows for shorter healing times. In some circumstances, the size can also make bone grafting surgery unnecessary since they need less supporting bone.
      - heading: HOW PAINFUL IS A DENTAL IMPLANT?
        content:
          Implants are relatively painless! Our wide array of anesthesia and sedation options thoroughly numb the area. Our dentists ensure you are never uncomfortable or nervous during any part of the procedure.
