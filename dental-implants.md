    heading: What Are the Benefits of Dental Implants?
    text: Dental implants in Bellflower have several benefits, especially when it comes to other dental options
    content:
      When comparing dental implants to other procedure options like <a href="/bellflower-ca/restorative-dentistry/tooth-crown/" target="_self">dental bridges</a> or dentures, there are several different benefits you receive with a tooth implant. Unlike dentures, dental implants are not removable. They are connected to your jawbone, so they can work and act as a real tooth, and not one that falls out. Implants can also replace your need for dentures completely, depending on how many implants you require. Another added benefit of implants is that they do not have the ability to become a cavity. They are the next best thing to your actual tooth without the worry of cavities or decay. Dental implants in Bellflower allow you to keep your smile looking natural, and the best thing is that they are much longer-lasting. Unlike bridges, a tooth implant is made to last a long period of time, rather than needing a replacement in a few years. Also, if you are considering bridges as an option for your teeth, you might want to know that bridges can damage their adjacent teeth. However, with a tooth implant, you donâ€™t have to worry about damaging other teeth, in fact, a dental implant can help protect your other teeth. Dental implants in Bellflower are one of the best options for tooth replacement. If you are interested in scheduling an appointment for a consultation about how implants can improve your smile, call us.

    faqs:
      - heading: What are dental implants?
        content:
          Dental implants are artificial tooth roots that are surgically placed into your jawbone. The implant will replace the root of a missing tooth, and act as an anchor for replacement teeth to be attached. The goal of dental implants is to provide you with lasting relief from discomfort caused by missing teeth, while giving you the confidence to smile again.
      - heading: Are you put to sleep for dental implants?
        content:
          Many people are put to sleep for dental implants. This is a common procedure that can be done in an office setting. Dental implants can be done in one day, and patients may choose to go under anesthesia. The implant is put right into the jaw bone, which heals up within six months. 
      - heading: Who is a good candidate for dental implants?
        content:
          Dental implants are a great way to replace missing teeth. They can be attached to your jawbone and function just like natural teeth. However, not everyone is a good candidate for dental implants, so it's important that you have them thoroughly discussed with your dentist before going through with the procedure.
      - heading: What are the advantages of dental implants?
        content:
          Dental implants are the newest advancement in modern dentistry that can help you overcome your dental problems. They can be used to replace missing teeth and restore full function of your jaw, as well as give you a beautiful smile. Because they look so natural, many people opt for them instead of removable prosthetics, such as dentures, which can oftentimes be cumbersome and embarrassing to wear in public places due to their bulky appearance.
      - heading: What is the success rate of dental implants?
        content:
          Dental implants are a very popular form of tooth replacement, but the success rate of dental implants can vary from patient to patient. Some patients have had great results with dental implants while others experience complications. 
      - heading: How long does it take for an implant to heal?
        content:
          The average healing time for a dental implant is four to six months. The day following the procedure, most patients are back at work. The over-the-counter medications available for pain relief are usually adequate. 
      - heading: How should I sleep after getting a dental implant?
        content:
          After dental implant surgery, we recommend elevating the head for at least 72 hours. This can be done by propping yourself up on pillows while you sleep. It is also possible to sleep in a recliner after your procedure for the first few days.
      - heading: How long is the implant process?
        content:
          In general, dental implant surgery is performed as an outpatient procedure in stages with periods of recovery between procedures. From start to finish, the process for placing a dental implant can take many months. The majority of that time is spent healing and waiting for new bone to grow in your jaw.
      - heading: Do dental implants look like real teeth?
        content:
          Dental implants are a great option for replacing missing teeth. Our Bellflower dentists create dental implants with great care to ensure that they look, feel, and fit just like your natural teeth. The objective is to create a clone of your missing tooth or teeth.
