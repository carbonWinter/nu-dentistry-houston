    heading: Fillings and How They Work
    text: Learn about how dental cavity fillings in Bellflower work
    content: Dental cavity fillings are needed as a response to tooth decay, but how does tooth decay happen? The mouth is full of different bacteria, and our teeth, gums, and tongues are where the bacteria live. There are good types of bacteria and bad types of bacteria. The bad bacteria are what causes tooth decay in Bellflower, and are what eats away at your teeth. When bad bacteria are left in the mouth too long, it pairs with the sugars you are putting in your mouth and creates an acid. Over time the acid eats away at your teeth causing a hole, or dental cavity. If you or a family member is experiencing pain because of tooth decay, please give us a call so we can help! Appointment scheduling is available 24/7 by phone.

    heading: What You Should Know About Dental Cavity Fillings
    text: Our team can help you get the best dental cavity fillings in Bellflower
    content:
      A lot of the time, a dental cavity filling in Bellflower is the first time someone has actually experienced dental work other than a regular cleaning. When this is the case, a dental cavity filling can be quite frightening if you don’t know what to expect. However, there isn’t anything to worry about because a filling is typically painless, with the exception of cavities close to your gum line. With that being said, our professional and caring staff here at Bellflower Dental Group will do what it takes to make sure you are completely comfortable, even if it requires sedation*. We want you to get the dental treatment you need in the most comfortable way possible. When it comes to the length of time it takes to fill a cavity, the actual filling process takes about 15 minutes. The area around the decayed tooth will be numbed with a gel before the filling takes place. Once your filling is completed, depending on the filling material, your filling should be expected to last at least 5 years, and in most cases many years longer. The important thing to remember is to take care of your teeth by brushing, flossing, and getting your regular dental cleanings** twice a year. This will help you defend your mouth from tooth decay in Bellflower, and also prevent more dental cavities from occurring. If you have any questions about tooth decay or dental cavity fillings, please feel free to call us. We would love to help!

    faqs:
      - heading: What is a surface cavity?
        content:
          DDental surface cavities are small holes or pits found on the enamel (outer layer) of a tooth. While these do not pose as much risk as those between teeth, it is important to treat them before they become bigger problems than they already are.
      - heading: What causes cavities?
        content:
          A cavity is a hole in the tooth caused by tooth decay. This can be caused by eating sugary foods, not brushing your teeth correctly, and drinking too much soda. 
      - heading: Do all cavities need fillings?
        content:
          Cavities in the back of your mouth may not always need a filling, but it is important to monitor and check them regularly to make sure they do not get any worse. A cavity that has gone untreated for too long could lead to much more serious dental issues down the line, such as infection or tooth loss. If you notice a painless spot on your teeth, call our office right away!
      - heading: What do dentists use to fill cavities?
        content:
          Some dentists use a material called dental amalgam to fill cavities in teeth. Dental amalgam is made up of mercury, silver, and copper in equal amounts. It's usually mixed with tin or zinc and heated until it becomes liquid before being poured into the tooth cavity. The mixture cools quickly, solidifying into a strong filling that resists decay for years at a time. 
      - heading: How long should fillings last?
        content:
          Dental fillings can last a long time, but it is still important to go in for regular checkups and cleanings. Fillings are made of materials that can break down over time, which leaves room for cavities to form. These cavities will need filling eventually, so you should get them taken care of before they become too large and cause more damage than necessary.
      - heading: How can you prevent cavities?
        content:
          Dental cavities are preventable with good oral hygiene habits such as brushing at least twice a day and flossing once a day. The best way to avoid getting cavities is to eat healthy snacks like fruit instead of candy bars and drink water instead of soda.
      - heading: What are different filling materials?
        content:
          The most common type of dental filling today is tooth-colored composite resin. Composite resins are made up of a mixture of glass particles, ceramic powder, polymer resin, and other additives such as plasticizers or pigments. This filling material has many advantages over silver amalgam fillings because it looks natural in color and texture while still being very strong against wear and tear from chewing or biting down on objects hard enough to chip enamel surfaces. 
      - heading: Does it hurt to fill a cavity?
        content:
          It is a common misconception that filling a cavity hurts. In fact, the tooth anesthetic numbs the nerves in your tooth and there will be no pain during or after treatment. Some people may feel some discomfort when they bite down on an area where we are doing work. The most important thing to do before getting dental work done is to visit Bellflower Dental Group for a checkup so that you can make sure everything's alright with your teeth.
      - heading: What to do after getting dental fillings?
        content:
          If you have just had fillings done on your teeth, then it is important to take care of them and make sure that they don't get infected. You should always brush your teeth after every meal and drink lots of water. It will help prevent plaque build-up and cavities from forming. If you are experiencing any pain or discomfort, contact a dentist as soon as possible.
