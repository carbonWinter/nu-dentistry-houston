    heading: AFFORDABLY TREAT YOUR CAVITIES IN HOUSTON
    text: DON’T LEAVE OFF YOUR TOOTH PAIN - GET TREATMENT TODAY!
    content: |-
      It is likely that you will encounter at least one cavity during your lifetime if you haven’t already. Even with the best oral hygiene habits, the need for a cavity filling can appear.

      What is a cavity? A dental cavity is tooth decay that wears away at your enamel until it burrows a little hole in your tooth. This decayed enamel leaves the softer, more vulnerable center of your tooth open to further decay and infection. If a tooth cavity is left untreated for too long, it can lead to needing more intensive procedures, like root canals or tooth extraction.

      Tooth decay symptoms include: toothache and pain; sensitivity to temperature and sweets; tooth staining or discoloration; or holes in your tooth. Even if you’re not experiencing cavity pain, you shouldn’t put off your treatment for too long. Waiting until the discomfort can’t be ignored means that the cavity may have progressed past needing a simple tooth filling and require more intensive and expensive care.

      If you think you may have a cavity, call our office at (832) 916-4144 to book a consultation.

      Getting a cavity isn’t the end of the world, and we can treat yours quickly and efficiently. Using top-of-the-line equipment and devices, we will numb the area around your tooth and remove any decay painlessly. Your tooth will be sanitized to prepare it for filling. We will then fill the cleaned area with either composite resin or porcelain to renew your tooth to its natural state.

      Our dentists take the time to ensure that the shape of your filling fits precisely with your bite. We always want to make sure that your tooth looks and feels just as it did when it was at full health. At NuDentistry, our detailed dentists make sure that the color of your dental fillings always matches perfectly with the rest of your teeth.

      We offer tooth-colored composite and porcelain fillings that blend in with your natural tooth, leaving you with a flawless smile! For those who want more of an aesthetic pop with their fillings, we also offer alternative material options, including gold and other metals. If you wish to discuss options for your upcoming procedure with your dentist, contact our office today.

      At Nu Dentistry, we're well-aware that patients can be nervous about their upcoming filling, especially if they've had bad experiences in the past with less than stellar dentists. That's why we commit ourselves so completely to our patients' full comfort. If you're interested in using one of these options for your upcoming treatment, call us today at (832) 916-4144.

      While our office offers local anesthesia for all restorations to numb the tooth and surrounding area thoroughly, we also have several **[sedation options](/houston-tx/specialty-dentistry/sedation-dentistry/)** available upon request:

        Also known as laughing gas, nitrous oxide lets patients feel euphoric and dulls anxiety when inhaled. Once the breathing mask is removed after treatment, the gas quickly works its way out of the patient's system within minutes.

      copy: 
        Stronger than laughing gas, oral sedation involves a pill that is taken an hour before a procedure. Patients will remain awake and able to talk to and answer the dentist, but they'll feel drowsy and relaxed enough throughout their treatment that they may fall asleep.

        IV sedation is the most robust option we provide, allowing for total sleep dentistry, and is best for patients with severe dental anxiety. While we don't recommend this method for a single filling, it's a good option for patients who will have multiple procedures done in a single day.

    heading: TOOTH DECAY STAGES
    text: NEVER WAIT TO GET DENTAL HELP!
    content: |-
      Just like Rome, tooth decay isn't built in a day. It takes time for plaque and bacteria to build up on your tooth and begin to wear away at the enamel. These are the five stages of tooth decay:

      - **White spots.** White spots can appear on your tooth as plaque builds up and starts wearing away the enamel. At this point, the decay is only a pre-cavity and can be reversed with proper treatment and maintenance, as directed by your dentist.
      - **Enamel decay.** Once plaque begins working at your enamel, it doesn't stop. The tooth's inner enamel begins to break, even as the outside appears to remain intact. At this stage, the cavity has progressed too far for anything but a dental filling to fix.
      - **Dentin decay.** After breaking through the enamel, the decay reaches your tooth's dentin. Dentin is the layer between the outer enamel and the inner pulp. You may experience pain at this stage of the cavity, which will only worsen as the cavity progresses.
      - **Dental pulp infection.** When the decay reaches your dental pulp, pus begins to fill the tooth and eat away at the tooth's blood vessels and nerves. At this stage, the decay is too far for a filling to fix, and a root canal is necessary.
      - **Abscess formation.** An abscess is a pocket of pus, either on the tooth or leaking into the nearby gum. You may experience swelling and acute pain. If the abscess bursts, it can cause serious health problems and should be treated immediately.

      - heading: CAN YOU MAKE A CAVITY GO AWAY?
        content:
          Once a cavity is fully formed, you, unfortunately, can’t just brush or floss it away. Cavities cause irreversible holes and damage to your enamel that require fillings or root canals to repair. However, there is a silver lining! Early on in tooth decay’s life, the tooth only has what’s known as a pre-cavity affecting only the outermost enamel layer. If caught in time, a patient might be able to restore and remineralize the tooth with fluoride and diligent oral health care.
      - heading: WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF A CAVITY IS LEFT UNTREATED?
        content:
          If you leave a cavity alone for too long, a number of problems can occur. The inner tooth may become infected, damaging the soft pulp and nerves of the tooth. If the infection spreads to the gums, it can create pus-filled abscesses or cause gum disease. At its worst, the tooth may become so corroded and brittle by decay that it may need extraction or fall out.
      - heading: WHAT DOES A CAVITY LOOK LIKE?
        content:
          There are many physical signs that you may have a dental cavity. Your teeth can be discolored, either a shade off from the rest of your healthy teeth or a particularly dark area surrounded by healthy white. At its most severe, your tooth may have black spots and holes visible. If you notice you have any teeth with these symptoms, call our office for a diagnosis.
      - heading: WHY DO I EASILY GET CAVITIES?
        content:
          If you feel like you’re prone to cavities, there may be several factors at play. Your diet can play a large part, such as eating highly acidic or sweet foods, and if you love to snack, consistently eating throughout the day can build up plaque faster. You might also have a dry mouth as saliva is vital in breaking down plaque, bacteria, and acids that can cause tooth decay. Some people are also unlucky enough to be born more vulnerable to the bacteria and plaque that love to cause cavities.   
      - heading: WHY DO I GET CAVITIES EVEN THOUGH I BRUSH AND FLOSS?
        content:
          Good dental hygiene doesn’t just involve healthy habits like brushing twice and flossing once a day. It also relies heavily on your lifestyle, such as what you eat and how often. Snackers tend to get cavities much faster, especially when they eat more sugary foods. You may also have lower saliva production, which makes it harder for your body to naturally fight off the plaque and bacteria that build up throughout the day.
      - heading: HOW MUCH DOES A CAVITY FILLING COST?
        content:
          "Dental fillings' costs depend on two main factors: the material used and the number of surfaces your dentist has to treat. A resin filling on a single surface is going to cost much less than a gold or porcelain filling across three surfaces. You'll want to speak with our dentist to determine which option works both financially and aesthetically for you."
