    heading: What Is the Temporomandibular Joint?
    text: Treating TMJ and jaw pain in Bellflower is easier when you understand the disorder
    content:
      In order to get TMJ relief, it is important that you understand the basics of your disorder and the treatment. The Temporomandibular joint is the joint that connects your jaw to your skull, which allows you to move it around freely. However, if you have TMJ, you are unable to do so, and instead feel a pain in your jaw while experiencing popping, clicking, or even locking of the joint. There are several different TMJ causes that may be attributing to your pain, such as the alignment of your teeth. If teeth alignment is the case, we have a few options for treatment to help get your teeth aligned* to relieve your TMJ pain, like Invisalign. We can also provide Botox injections for relaxing your jaw muscles, nighttime appliances, and corrective jaw surgery for treating TMJ in Bellflower. It is also important to recognize some things you can do on your own to help eliminate the pain temporarily. Those who suffer with TMJ disorder often clench or grind the teeth together, which can make your disorder worse. You can take over-the-counter pain medications such as aspirin or Tylenol to help with the pain, or you can apply a heating pad to the area and eat a soft food diet. Each TMJ case is different, so it takes proper examination by a professional to find the cause of your pain, and also to suggest the correct mode of treatment. If you are having trouble with jaw pain in Bellflower, please give us a call, so we can get your TMJ treatment started as soon as possible.

    faqs:
      - heading: What is the main cause of TMJ?
        content:
          TMJ disorder happens when joints become inflamed and don't move smoothly, causing symptoms like painful chewing; limited ability to open your mouth; difficulty speaking because of facial muscle spasms; tension headache; clicking sounds with jaw movement; popping or grating sound when opening and closing your mouth; and restricted opening.
      - heading: What are the early signs of TMJ?
        content:
          The symptoms of TMJ can be difficult to identify, and it is important to be aware of the common warning signs. Constant pain in jaw muscles or joints that worsen with chewing, clenching teeth, or biting down may indicate a problem. Pain in the teeth is often experienced by those who have worn their teeth down due to grinding and clenching habits. Additionally, headaches may occur when trying to sleep at night if there is an issue with your mouth. If you are experiencing any of these issues, please contact your dentist immediately for further examination!
      - heading: Is TMJ serious?
        content:
          TMJ is a condition that affects the joint in your jaw. It can cause chronic pain, headaches, and difficulty chewing food. The symptoms of TMJ are often dismissed as mere aches or pains because they are so common. But it's important to be aware of these early warning signs so you can get treatment before the problem worsens.
      - heading: What are the long term effects of TMJ?
        content:
          Having TMJ can lead to other issues, such as headaches and migraines. These conditions are often caused by the way you chew your food or how your jaw is aligned. If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to seek treatment from a professional dentist in order to prevent more serious problems down the road.
      - heading: How do you test for TMJ?
        content:
          There are many ways to test for TMJ, but the most common is through a simple jaw exam. The doctor will ask you to open your mouth wide and close it with their hands on both sides of your head. They will then feel the upper teeth on each side of your head touching against one another. If they notice any significant pressure or pain when this happens, they may suspect that there is an issue with the TMJ. This can be caused by clenching or grinding the teeth together often, an injury, or just getting older! Luckily there are many treatments available, including massage therapy, orthodontics (braces), and surgery if needed. 
      - heading: What will happen if TMJ is not treated?
        content:
          Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disease is a chronic condition that affects the jaw, mouth, and teeth. It can cause pain or tenderness in your face, neck, or head. If left untreated, TMJ may lead to more serious health problems like headaches, earaches, and heartburn.
      - heading: What will a dentist do for TMJ?
        content:
          Your dentist can provide relief from the pain that is associated with this condition, such as headaches and earaches. When it comes time for treatment, your dentist may recommend an orthotic device to wear at night while sleeping. This device will keep your jaw in place and reduce the amount of movement that occurs when you open and close your mouth.
      - heading: How long does a TMJ flare-up last?
        content:
          Many people who experience TMJ flare-up for the first time are often concerned about how long it will last. The best way to answer this question is to think of an episode as a single event. An individual may have multiple flare-ups for various reasons, but each one is considered its own occurrence. When answering how long does TMJ flare-up last, you should also consider what type of therapy they're receiving and what type of pain medication they're taking if any at all.
      - heading: What is the best treatment for TMJ?
        content:
          Treatment for TMJ can vary depending on the severity of the condition. Some people simply need to adjust their bite and change tooth grinding habits, while others may require more complicated procedures such as surgery. If you suspect that you may have TMD, then visit your doctor to get properly diagnosed. Once identified as having TMJ disorder, there are several treatment options available such as physical therapy and medication (NSAIDS) which can help reduce swelling and relieve pain.
