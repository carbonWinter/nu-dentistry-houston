    text: IMPROVE YOUR LIFESTYLE WITH REMOVABLE DENTURES
    content: |-
      Have you had one or more teeth extracted and are looking for a replacement? After having a tooth extracted, it’s important to find the right replacement option for you. Leaving your missing teeth as they are, including gaps, can have serious long-term problems. Facial muscle sagging, shifting of remaining teeth, and further tooth infection and loss often occur.

      Dentures are a solid choice, used by millions of Americans every day because they’re flexible to your individual needs. From partial to complete dentures, they can easily replace one or more extracted teeth—even your full set of teeth, top and bottom—meaning our denture dentists can always accommodate you. Our team guarantees that your new teeth will be great for you. We have them built using molds of your mouth so that they always fit the first time you wear them, and they look just as flawless and natural as you’d ever dreamed.

      See your quality of life skyrocket from the moment you receive your dentures. Benefits from choosing dentures include: a beautiful, natural-looking smile; improved and confident speech; fewer dietary restrictions; avoid facial sagging; boosted self-esteem; and functional and comfortable. Dentures are also easily removable, making upkeep and cleaning them uncomplicated and stress-free.

      If you need denture repair, our team is here to help. We’re fast and efficient, making sure you can leave our office with your mended and adjusted dentures in as quickly as one appointment. At Nu Dentistry, we believe no one should go without a proper teeth replacement. If you’re looking forward to your new life with dentures, call our office today!

    - heading: COMPLETE DENTURES
      copy: |-
        Complete dentures are what most people think of as dentures. These are removable false teeth that replace every tooth in your mouth or arch. With a gum-colored plastic base, traditional dentures hold a full set of porcelain or plastic teeth. They are custom-tailored for your mouth using molds made following your denture extraction. Your dentures should fit perfectly to your gums, staying in place even without denture adhesive.

    - heading: PARTIAL DENTURES
      copy: 
        Not everyone needs to replace most or all of their teeth. For patients who only need replacements for a few teeth in the same region of the mouth, a partial denture is a great option. The replacement teeth, often made of acrylic or porcelain, will be attached to a pink plastic base similar to regular complete dentures. Partials use metal clasps to secure themselves onto the teeth on either side of the missing tooth gap, keeping them in place while speaking and eating.

    - heading: IMMEDIATE DENTURES
      copy: 
        Immediate dentures, or temporary dentures, are false teeth that are made before your teeth extraction. With immediate dentures, you can walk away from your removal with brand new pearly whites. The molds are made before your extraction, rather than after as what happens with permanent dentures. However, because your bones and gums may shift over time, you may need your immediate dentures either adjusted or replaced.

    - heading: IMPLANT-SUPPORTED
      copy: 
        Patients who want a more stabilized bite and speech can choose to have implant-supported dentures. Implants are metal posts or screws anchored and fused to your jawbone through surgery. They’re connected to your dentures by a piece called an abutment. While the implants are not removable, your replacement teeth are, making them just as easy to maintain and clean as other dentures. A denture with implants is also extremely natural-looking and long-lasting.

    heading: WISDOM TOOTH REMOVAL
    text: WE PUT YOUR LONG-TERM DENTAL HEALTH FIRST.
    content: |-
      Wisdom teeth extractions might seem drastic and terrifying to patients, but they are exceedingly common. In fact, over 10 million Americans have successfully had their wisdom teeth removed at some point in their lives. Not all wisdom teeth need to be extracted. However, studies have shown that up to 85% of all teens and adults need at least one wisdom tooth removed.

      Reasons why wisdom teeth may need to be extracted:

      - **Tooth direction.** Sometimes a wisdom tooth will emerge sideways or tilted from the gum.
      - **Impaction.** Wisdom teeth that are unable to fully emerge from the gum can lead to infection or tooth decay. In worst-case scenarios, they can cause severe gum disease, cysts, and tumors.
      - **Crowded and crooked teeth.** An incoming wisdom tooth can seriously damage nearby teeth and disrupt the alignment of your arch. This crowding can lead to the need for braces or other costly procedures that could otherwise have been avoided.
      - **Too little space.** If there's not enough room for a wisdom tooth to erupt, it can lead to partial eruption as well as infection and decay.
      - **Pain.** Toothaches and pain are never a good sign, and depending on your specific case can lead to multiple immediate and future problems.
      - **Orthodontic problems.** For teens and adults with braces or clear aligners like Invisalign, incoming wisdom teeth can be a nightmare. They run the risk of losing those patients all of their hard-earned straightening progress, setting them back to square one—or worse.

      If you have any questions or concerns about a possible wisdom tooth removal for you or your child, call our office at (832) 916-4144 to set up a consultation.

      - heading: WHAT IS TOOTH EXTRACTION?
        content:
          Tooth extraction is a dental procedure in which your dentist removes a tooth from your mouth. Extractions may be needed for many reasons. Your tooth is damaged beyond repair. The tooth is unable to emerge from your gums. Or the tooth may be impacted, and its emerging will disrupt your teeth's alignment, requiring costly and time-consuming dental work to **straighten your teeth**.
      - heading: WHEN SHOULD A TOOTH BE REMOVED?
        content:
          A tooth should be removed only when it poses a threat to the health of the rest of your mouth. Nu Dentistry is dedicated to saving and restoring as many of your teeth as possible! However, saving a tooth may not always be possible when it comes to severely infected, impacted, and crowded teeth. If it's possible to repair your tooth without extraction, then we recommend you always choose this less drastic treatment, if possible.
      - heading: DOES TOOTH EXTRACTION HURT?
        content:
          Thanks to modern-day anesthesia, even surgical tooth extraction can be completely painless! Local anesthesia thoroughly numbs the tooth and surrounding area, so you're always comfortable during your extraction. If you're at all anxious about your treatment, we offer a number of safe sedation options to help ease your mind as well as your body.
      - heading: WHAT DOES A TOOTH EXTRACTION COST?
        content:
          Depending on the location of the tooth, the type of extraction ( simple or surgical) done, and what method of anesthesia or sedation will be used, the price for your tooth removal may vary. Wisdom tooth removals, for example, have their price separate from standard surgical extractions.       
      - heading: IS IT OK NOT TO REPLACE A MISSING TOOTH?
        content:
          It's dentist-recommended that you replace your removed tooth to save yourself a lot of potential pain and money in the future. Missing teeth not only lead to bone and structural deterioration, but your surrounding teeth will shift to fill the gaps. Those teeth often become at risk of gum disease, which can lead to them falling out or needing extraction as well. Replacement teeth help maintain the structure and integrity of your mouth, far extending the lifespan of your smile.
      - heading: IS IT REALLY NECESSARY TO REMOVE IMPACTED WISDOM TEETH?
        content:
          While not always necessary for everyone, impacted wisdom tooth extraction can be extremely crucial in a patient's dental development and overall health. If wisdom teeth are unable to fully emerge, you can't properly clean or maintain them. Tooth decay and gum disease are often quick to follow. In some instances, this can lead to cysts and tumor development. At Nu Dentistry, we only recommend that at-risk teeth be removed, and we take great care to ensure you always retain your healthiest smile possible.
