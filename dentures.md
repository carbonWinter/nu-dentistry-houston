    text: IMPROVE YOUR LIFESTYLE WITH REMOVABLE DENTURES
    content: |-
      Have you had one or more teeth extracted and are looking for a replacement? After having a tooth extracted, it’s important to find the right replacement option for you. Leaving your missing teeth as they are, including gaps, can have serious long-term problems. Facial muscle sagging, shifting of remaining teeth, and further tooth infection and loss often occur.

      Dentures are a solid choice, used by millions of Americans every day because they’re flexible to your individual needs. From partial to complete dentures, they can easily replace one or more extracted teeth—even your full set of teeth, top and bottom—meaning our denture dentists can always accommodate you. Our team guarantees that your new teeth will be great for you. We have them built using molds of your mouth so that they always fit the first time you wear them, and they look just as flawless and natural as you’d ever dreamed.

      See your quality of life skyrocket from the moment you receive your dentures. Benefits from choosing dentures include: a beautiful, natural-looking smile; improved and confident speech; fewer dietary restrictions; avoid facial sagging; boosted self-esteem; and functional and comfortable. Dentures are also easily removable, making upkeep and cleaning them uncomplicated and stress-free.

      If you need denture repair, our team is here to help. We’re fast and efficient, making sure you can leave our office with your mended and adjusted dentures in as quickly as one appointment. At Nu Dentistry, we believe no one should go without a proper teeth replacement. If you’re looking forward to your new life with dentures, call our office today!

    - heading: COMPLETE DENTURES
      copy: |-
        Complete dentures are what most people think of as dentures. These are removable false teeth that replace every tooth in your mouth or arch. With a gum-colored plastic base, traditional dentures hold a full set of porcelain or plastic teeth. They are custom-tailored for your mouth using molds made following your denture extraction. Your dentures should fit perfectly to your gums, staying in place even without denture adhesive.

    - heading: PARTIAL DENTURES
      copy: 
        Not everyone needs to replace most or all of their teeth. For patients who only need replacements for a few teeth in the same region of the mouth, a partial denture is a great option. The replacement teeth, often made of acrylic or porcelain, will be attached to a pink plastic base similar to regular complete dentures. Partials use metal clasps to secure themselves onto the teeth on either side of the missing tooth gap, keeping them in place while speaking and eating.

    - heading: IMMEDIATE DENTURES
      copy: 
        Immediate dentures, or temporary dentures, are false teeth that are made before your teeth extraction. With immediate dentures, you can walk away from your removal with brand new pearly whites. The molds are made before your extraction, rather than after as what happens with permanent dentures. However, because your bones and gums may shift over time, you may need your immediate dentures either adjusted or replaced.

    - heading: IMPLANT-SUPPORTED
      copy: 
        Patients who want a more stabilized bite and speech can choose to have implant-supported dentures. Implants are metal posts or screws anchored and fused to your jawbone through surgery. They’re connected to your dentures by a piece called an abutment. While the implants are not removable, your replacement teeth are, making them just as easy to maintain and clean as other dentures. A denture with implants is also extremely natural-looking and long-lasting.

    text: HOW TO DECIDE WHICH CHOICE IS BEST FOR YOU
    content: |-
      When replacing only a single or few missing teeth in one area of your mouth, it can be hard to decide which replacement option to choose. Partial dentures or dental bridges are both good choices, but which one is better? Dental bridges are false teeth that are permanently attached to your mouth. The two teeth on either side of your gap are filed down to fit a crown while your artificial teeth are connected between them as a single piece. While often made of porcelain to blend in with your natural teeth, bridges can also be made of gold or other metals. Because your replacement teeth are solidly secured to the rest of your mouth, bridges offer a more stabilized bite than dentures. However, they also place stress on the supporting teeth, meaning good dental hygiene habits and care are needed to ensure your bridge’s longevity. While bridges can replace up to 4 teeth in a row, most dentists recommend partial dentures for multiple teeth replacements. If your dental health history is somewhat checkered, it can be more cost-effective to choose an option that doesn’t rely on strong, healthy anchoring teeth. Another advantage of partial dentures is that they are removable, making their cleaning and maintenance relatively easy compared to bridges. Dental bridges require special attention to clean between the false tooth and gums; otherwise, patients run the risk of further tooth and gum problems. If you need help deciding which option is best for you, call our office today to consult with our experts.

    faqs:
      - heading: HOW MUCH DO DENTURES COST?
        content:
          Pricing for dentures is dependent on several factors. What type of denture will be made (partial, full, implant-supported)? What materials will be used (acrylic, cast metal, flexible plastic)? Will there be immediate dentures prepared following extraction? If you’re at all concerned about your replacement teeth costs, contact our office to discuss your financial options. We want to make sure that our patients always receive the dentures they deserve in a manner they can afford.
      - heading: DO IMMEDIATE DENTURES LOOK NATURAL?
        content:
          Immediate dentures are prepared through molds of your teeth prior to extraction, so they’re just as natural-looking as regular dentures. Our dentists want to ensure you’re always comfortable with your smile, so we take great care that your false teeth fit and look better than your real ones have in years.
      - heading: CAN I GET MY TEETH PULLED AND DENTURES ON THE SAME DAY?
        content:
          Yes. After your teeth are pulled, your denture dentist can set you up with immediate dentures that will act as temporary replacements while your permanent dentures are being made. To have your immediate dentures prepared in time, you may have to schedule an appointment before your extraction so that a mold of your mouth can be done.
      - heading: CAN YOU SLEEP IN DENTURES?
        content:
          While you may want to, we highly recommend that you don’t wear your dentures at night. Taking out your false teeth while sleeping gives your gums time to rest and heal, and it prolongs the longevity of your dentures. Bacteria and stains are prevented from building up overnight, preventing potential health conditions that can arise.      
      - heading: Do dentures make you look older?
        content:
          Not at all! Dentures can help you retain a more youthful appearance. Leaving your missing teeth alone can result in facial sagging. Replacement teeth like dentures help keep your facial structure as it is. They look as natural as your natural teeth, so you always stay looking happy and healthy.
      - heading: CAN I GET DENTURES WITH NO TEETH?
        content:
          You do not need any remaining teeth to get dentures. While partial dentures replace only a select few teeth, complete dentures are full teeth replacements for your entire arch or mouth. Millions of Americans use full dentures to improve their lives, and you can too.
