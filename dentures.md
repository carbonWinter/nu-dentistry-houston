    text: Dentures in Bellflower can help you restore your smile to its full potential

They look amazing and will fit you properly, so there is no need to worry about accidents, such as your dentures falling out. You'll also have hardly any wait, because we have our own labs and can do 1-day dentures and denture repair. Let us help you get the smile you dream of having. Check out our patient reviews, and see just how much other patients love their new smiles!

    heading: What Can Dentures Do For You?
    text: False teeth in Bellflower are a wonderful way to restore your smile with added benefits
    content:
      You may be considering dentures or false teeth without knowing just how much they can actually benefit you. Besides their ability to give you the complete and beautiful smile you want, there are other advantages to dentures as well. Because missing teeth or gaps in teeth can make one feel insecure about smiling, studies show that dentures can improve the overall self-esteem of those who wear them. Not only can they improve the appearance of your smile, but dentures also support your facial muscles to give you a more youthful appearance. By choosing to wear dentures, you also increase your overall health by lessening your chances of oral bone loss. Dentures in Bellflower provide your entire mouth with the structure it needs to defend against other problems that may occur without teeth. However, one of the best and most obvious advantages to false teeth is their ability to allow you to speak and eat like normal. With cosmetic dentures, you are able to eat almost all of your favorite foods without hesitation. Not to mention the cost of this tooth replacement option is affordable, especially at Bellflower Dental Group. Our staff is here to help you. Your satisfaction with all aspects of your procedure, including costs, is our top priority. If you would like to schedule an appointment with us, call us any time.

    faqs:
      - heading: What are permanent dentures?
        content:
          Permanent dentures are used to replace missing teeth and can be made from metal, plastic, or a combination of both. They can be attached to the jaw by dental implants* or other means such as dental adhesive. The procedure for fitting permanent dentures is not quick and simple; it takes time and patience before you get comfortable with your new set of teeth.
      - heading: Why do people get dentures?
        content:
          Dentures are a great option for those who have missing teeth. They can be made to look just like your natural teeth and they can help you eat, speak and smile as if nothing was ever wrong. Dentures help maintain the shape of your face, and it also prevents other teeth from shifting out of position. 
      - heading: What is the average age for dentures?
        content:
          Dentures are a great way to restore your smile and make you feel like yourself again. The average age for receiving dentures is 65 years old, but they can be used at many different stages in life as well.
      - heading: Can you sleep in dentures?
        content:
          Many people have been wondering if it is possible to sleep in dentures. While there are a number of different reasons why people might not be able to wear dentures during the night, sleeping in them can actually be dangerous because they could fall out and get lost.
      - heading: Can I get my teeth pulled and dentures in the same day?
        content:
          Yes. If you need to get your teeth pulled* and dentures in the same day, it's important that you do so with a qualified dentist.
      - heading: What are the benefits of dentures?
        content:
          Dentures are a great alternative for those individuals who have lost teeth. Dentures serve many purposes, such as restoring the ability to chew food properly, replacing missing teeth, which greatly affects your appearance and confidence, and even preventing other teeth from shifting out of place due to lack of support.
      - heading: What are the different types of dentures?
        content:
          "Dentures come in two types: complete dentures and partial dentures. Complete dentures replace all of the remaining teeth while a partial denture replaces some but not all of them. The major benefit is that you will be able to chew food with comfort again after having lost your natural teeth due to decay or injury!"
      - heading: Can dentures look natural?
        content:
          Dentures can look natural. It all depends on the way they are fitted and how well a dentist pays attention to detail. There is a difference in appearance between dentures made from acrylic, polyurethane, or silicone materials. Acrylic dentures have a hard surface which makes them more likely to chip or break when biting into something tough. Polyurethane and silicone dentures have a softer surface that won't chip as easily but may be more difficult to clean because stains will show up easier than with acrylics which will hide discolorations better.
      - heading: Does medical insurance cover dentures?
        content:
          Many major medical health plans include dental coverage, but stand-alone dental plans may also be available. These plans typically cover oral exams, cleanings, X-rays, fillings, and other preventive dental care. Some plans may also help with some of the costs for oral surgery, implants, and dentures.
