        text: |-
          Dr. Tsibel received his doctoral degree from the Tashkent School of Dentistry with a 4.0 GPA and honors in 1976. He then pursued his Ph.D in 1982 in Prosthodontics with an emphasis in oral surgery, and graduated with a 4.0 GPA with honors.

          "I consider myself fortunate to have a career that allows me to support my family and provides me with a daily sense of accomplishment. I don’t have to force myself to come to work each and every morning because I genuinely enjoy what I do. Undoubtedly, it's easier to achieve a certain level of success when it is based upon a profound interest in your occupation. It is this interest in the devotion to my profession that motivates me to continuously advance my skills. I strive to polish my patient interaction skills and my theoretical and practical knowledge of dentistry. I must admit, that I if did not receive the current degree of satisfaction from my practice, I would explore my passion for teaching. While I have pursued the latest advancements in dentistry, I have simultaneously shared my discoveries with colleagues. It has taken years to reach my present understanding of implantology and laser dentistry. The next best thing to witnessing the satisfaction and amazing results of my patients is the transfer of information to other dentists. While I realize that I will always have more to learn and an everlasting thirst for new knowledge, it is a privilege and an honor to be respected by my colleagues. At the end of a long and often stressful day, while driving home to my family, I know that my techniques and expertise have improved the quality of life of others. The improvement may be as subtle as a prettier smile that lends itself to increased self-confidence. The change in a patient’s life may be as significant as the ability to chew, increased appetite, decreased pain, or the ability to communicate more effectively. In many cases the results of treatment can improve overall health and quality of life. Sincerely, dentistry gives as much back to me as I give to it."

          The most precious and exciting aspect of orthodontics for me is bringing a smile to my patients' faces, and knowing that my work had a meaningful impact on their lives. Orthodontics can be a fun and inspiring journey for our patients, and I love to be a part of such a life-changing experience on a daily basis.
