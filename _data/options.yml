  - heading: The Best Dentist in Houston
    copy: We have been looking for a family dentist for a long time, we have tried a bunch of places but nothing felt quite like home.  Not too long ago we stumbled upon Nu Dentistry and met Dr. Ali. Not only was he professional, kind, and gentle, but he always finds a way to fit us in when we need an appointment. He’s also pretty funny! I appreciate that he takes the time to explain what he’s doing, before he does it. That really puts me at ease.

  - heading: Part of the Family
    copy: When I come in for an exam, Dr. Alrajab makes me feel like I’m a part of his family. I haven’t had a single cavity or filling done since I started coming here, which is a real change from my last hygienist.

  - heading: Anxiety Has Kept Me Away...
    copy: I usually have such huge anxiety when I go to a dentist appointment, which means I always put off visits until the last minute to disastrous consequences. However, Dr. Loggins helped me with sedation, so the entire process was a breeze!

  - heading: Never Thought I'd Say It...
    copy: I never thought I’d say it, but going to the dentist is actually fun now. I recently came in for a root canal, and I got to sit back and catch up on Stranger Things without any pain!
