    heading: PAINLESSLY TREAT YOUR GINGIVITIS IN HOUSTON
    text: LET US HELP YOU PROTECT YOUR SMILE
    content: |-
      Do you have constant gum pain or notice that your gums easily bleed when you brush or floss your teeth? If so, you may have gingivitis, the earliest form of gum disease, or periodontal disease.

      What is gum disease? Gum disease is an infection and inflammation of the gums caused by a buildup of plaque, tartar, and bacteria on your teeth. As it worsens, it can begin to affect the jawbone supporting your teeth, leading to your teeth shifting, loosening, or even falling out!

      Gum disease symptoms include: bleeding gums while brushing or flossing; swollen, red, or tender gums; receding gum line/teeth appearing longer; loose or separating teeth; sensitive teeth; pain when chewing; partial dentures no longer fitting correctly; and persistent bad breath.

      Don’t worry; there’s no reason to panic. At NuDentistry, our team of incredible dentists and periodontists makes it easy for you to receive gingivitis treatment. We always make sure to catch your gum disease at its earliest stages and take care of it as soon as possible. We’re dedicated to preserving your smile, however we can.

    text: NU DENTISTRY WANTS YOU TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY YOUR GUM DISEASE AS SOON AS IT DEVELOPS
    copy: |- 
      The earlier you and our periodontist catch your gum disease, the better. When caught and treated in its earliest form, it can still be fully cured. However, that depends on patients identifying symptoms as they appear and seeing the dentist for treatment. Periodontal disease is serious, and something not to be ignored. Once it progresses past its first stage, the damage can’t be undone, only managed. You and your periodontist must work together as a team to combat its effects and keep your mouth healthy.

      There are four stages for gum disease:

      copy: |-
        Gingivitis is the earliest stage of gum disease, characterized most often by bleeding gums while brushing and flossing. Gingivitis is the only form of periodontal disease that is fully reversible. At this stage, the damage caused by plaque and bacteria buildup hasn’t reached the bone or connective tissue that keeps your teeth firmly in place in your mouth. It can be cured in as little as 10 to 14 days with good oral hygiene and dentist visits.

    - heading: "STAGE 2: MILD PERIODONTITIS"
      copy: 
        The next level of periodontal disease is periodontitis. In this stage, irreversible damage occurs to the jawbone and gum tissue securing your teeth in their proper place. As the gums begin to pull away from the teeth, pockets start to form that allow food and plaque to get stuck and quicken up the pace of decay. At this point, the symptoms and decay can only be treated as they arise. The root problem can’t be taken care of for good.

    - heading: "STAGE 3: MODERATE PERIODONTITIS"
      copy: 
        Once gum disease progresses into moderate periodontitis, your teeth become loose as the gums further recede, and the bone begins to decay. The pockets between teeth and gums grow deeper, and the inflammation and decay worsens. Your gums may start bleeding even when not brushing or flossing your teeth.

    - heading: "STAGE 4: ADVANCED PERIODONTITIS"
      copy: 
        In the last and most severe form of periodontitis, a patient’s gums, bones, and connective tissue are not only damaged but destroyed. Teeth shift or further loosen, and they can eventually fall out if aggressive treatment is not immediately given. Even if the teeth haven’t fallen out, your dentist may **remove them** to save you a lot of pain and time in the future.

    text: WE HELP YOU GET BACK ON TRACK WITH YOUR PERIODONTAL HEALTH
    content: |-
      Depending on your stage of development, you may need different procedures to treat your gum disease. Treatments include:

      **At-home dental care.** The number one way to fight periodontal disease, especially in the earliest stage, is to establish a good, healthy oral hygiene routine. Flossing once and brushing your teeth at least twice a day are critical to clearing your teeth of plaque and bacteria and keeping them from building up again. You may also want to look into a toothbrush that works well for you, mainly because having the right brushing technique can change the effectiveness of your strokes.

      **Deep cleaning.** A procedure also called scaling and root planing. This procedure goes a bit deeper than your standard cleaning by scraping away the plaque buildup beneath the gums and smooths the teeth to prevent bacteria from forming again later. This treatment can be performed for your whole mouth or any of the four quadrants (upper right, upper left, lower right, lower left.)

      **Bone and tissue grafting.** In the worst stages, gum disease can cause gums and bones to deteriorate. When this happens, your dentist may need to perform a graft to replace and repair what’s missing. Grafting helps keep teeth secured and supported in your mouth and can be the deciding factor between you and loose or fallen teeth.

      **Pocket Reduction Procedure.** A deep cleaning can clear up the bacteria and plaque that have formed, but it can’t stop more from burrowing their way under your gum line. Gum pockets can be so deep that keeping them clean becomes increasingly difficult or seemingly impossible. If this is the case, your periodontist may recommend you receive a pocket reduction. This treatment involves removing the infected tissue and allows the gums to try reattaching themselves to the teeth.

      - heading: DOES GINGIVITIS GO AWAY?
        content:
          Gingivitis can go away, both through deep dental cleanings and excellent dental hygiene. Gingivitis is the first stage of periodontal disease. It’s early enough in the process that cleaning your teeth and gums properly and allowing them to heal is possible. However, more advanced stages of periodontal disease can only be managed, not completely cured.
      - heading: DOES LISTERINE CURE GINGIVITIS?
        content:
          While Listerine and other mouthwashes can help fight gingivitis, they’re not a cure-all. The best way to cure gingivitis is to practice all-around good dental hygiene habits. This means that in addition to using mouthwash, you should also be making sure to floss once and brush your teeth twice daily.
      - heading: IS IT PAINFUL TO GET A DEEP CLEANING AT THE DENTIST?
        content:
          Not at all! Using a local anesthetic, your periodontist will make sure that your teeth and gums are fully numb throughout your deep cleaning. If you’re at all nervous about your treatment, our office also offers a selection of sedation options to soothe your dental anxiety.
      - heading: CAN PERIODONTAL DISEASE KILL YOU?
        content:
          While you can’t die directly from periodontal disease, there is a significant link between gum disease and other serious health problems. At its worst, bacteria and infection can enter your bloodstream and spread to the rest of your body. Patients with periodontal disease have an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, and breast cancer.       
      - heading: WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF GUM DISEASE?
        content:
          If you notice that your gums bleed easily while brushing or flossing, your teeth feel loose, or you experience pain while eating, you may have gum disease. Other signs include painful swollen gums, changes in your bite, bad breath that stays after brushing your teeth, and sensitivity to hot and cold.
      - heading: HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU GET A DEEP CLEANING?
        content:
          Many factors determine the length between your deep cleaning visits. Your dentist will tell you how often you need to come into the office to maintain excellent periodontal health. Because gum disease has different stages, you may require deep cleaning treatments as often as every three months. At Nu Dentistry, we want to make sure that your gums are at their best, and making sure that your oral health doesn’t slide from missing your deep cleaning appointments is critical.
