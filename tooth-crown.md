    heading: Protect Your Tooth With a Crown
    text: Dental crowns in Bellflower are one of the best ways to protect your teeth from further decay
    content: Dental crowns are used to protect weakening teeth from tooth decay* or breaking. A crown holds together a tooth that has been previously broken or damaged. A tooth crown can also be used to cover a tooth that has an unusual shape or color. A lot of the time dental crowns are used to aid other dental procedures, such as bridges or implants. However, one of the most common uses for a tooth crown in Bellflower is to help cover a filling when the filled tooth doesn’t have very much support, or tooth, left. We have our own on-site lab which means a very quick turnaround for crowns and very little wait for you. If you think you may be in a position that requires dental crowns in Bellflower, please don’t hesitate to give us a call with any questions. You can also schedule your appointment by calling us today.

    heading: Dental Crowns and Your Treatment Options
    text: Dental crowns in Bellflower at Bellflower Dental Group come with two different options for your procedure
    content:
      At Bellflower Dental Group, we offer two options for the tooth crown process, which you should be aware of. First is the traditional, or lab-created option for a tooth crown. With lab-created dental crowns in Bellflower, your crown procedure is done over a span of multiple visits, in order to have the custom fit crown created and fitted properly to your tooth. Your first visit will involve examination and x-rays of your tooth to make sure other procedures are not needed, such as a root canal*. Once examined, the tooth will then be prepared for the crown, and an impression of your tooth will be taken and sent to the lab for a custom fit. While waiting to receive the permanent crown, a temporary crown will be placed. On your second visit, your tooth crown will be placed and examined for proper fit and color. The other is an option for CEREC dental crowns, which are same-day permanent crowns that are created during your treatment by the CEREC milling machine. The tooth crown is made to fit your tooth perfectly by computer-aided design that takes digital impressions of your teeth. The CEREC machine mills out your dental crowns within just a few minutes, requiring no need for added appointments. If you would like to schedule an appointment for dental crowns in Bellflower, call us 24/7. We are always available to take your call!

      - heading: What happens when you get a crown?
        content:
          A crown is a type of dental restoration that can be used to cover a tooth's entire surface. The crown covers the tooth and provides additional strength and protection for it. It also prevents further damage from occurring to the tooth, such as fracturing or breaking off entirely. This way, you get an extra layer of protection for all parts of your tooth - protecting them from any other injury when biting into something hard. 
      - heading: What are dental crowns made of?
        content:
          A crown is a dental restoration that covers a tooth and holds it in place. There are many different types of crowns, but the most common type is called an "all-porcelain" or ceramic crown. In order to prepare for your new all-ceramic crown, your dentist will remove the old filling material from inside your tooth and then shape and polish its surface with special instruments. 
      - heading: How long do dental crowns last?
        content:
          Dental crowns are built to last for a long time, but there are several factors which can affect how long they will remain in place, including food and drink choices, oral hygiene habits, and other environmental factors like trauma or injury. 
      - heading: How do dentists adjust crowns?
        content:
          The dentist will need to ensure that the crown is not too tight or too loose, but just right. If it's too tight, then it may be uncomfortable and irritate the gums of the patient; if it's too loose, then there could be problems with biting into food or speaking clearly. Crowns are typically adjusted by filing down part of them so that they fit perfectly over surrounding teeth without being either too big or small.
      - heading: What is a full porcelain crown?
        content:
          Porcelain crowns are extremely strong teeth restorations that are made to replace the natural enamel of a tooth. They can be used to cover up decayed or damaged teeth, restore broken down teeth, and even to change the shape of an existing tooth. While porcelain is considered more aesthetically pleasing than other options, it also tends to be one of the most durable types of dental restorations available.
      - heading: Do porcelain crowns change color?
        content:
          Porcelain crowns are made by a dental lab and can be used to repair teeth with large cavities or extensive decay. They are created from ceramic, which is fired at high temperatures in an oven. While porcelain does not change color due to temperature changes, it does have the potential for staining over time if you don't take proper care of your mouth between dental appointments.
      - heading: How much is a dental crown? 
        content:
          Dental crowns are often used to cover a tooth that is damaged or decayed. While they are strong and durable, the price of dental crowns can vary depending on your existing tooth and the material you choose for your new crown. 
      - heading: Can a permanent crown move?
        content:
          It is possible for dental crowns to become loose, but it is not very common. There are various reasons why crowns can become loose, including traumatic injuries or impacts, an old or broken crown, tooth decay, lack of dental care, sticky foods, or tooth clenching and grinding.
      - heading: How is a porcelain crown made?
        content:
          Porcelain is a type of material that can be made into thin, translucent layers and then bonded over the tooth's surface to create a strong restoration. To make porcelain crowns, technicians use an impression of your mouth to create a custom-fitting mold for the dental lab. This mold is then used to create your new tooth crown.
