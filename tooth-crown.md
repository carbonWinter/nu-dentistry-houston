      Sometimes, despite our best efforts, we can get cavities. We forget to floss for a few days, or we snack on a few too many sweets between dental visits. Here at Nu Dentistry, we understand that sometimes the tooth decay can run a little too deep, and a filling isn’t enough to fix it anymore. When this is the case, we recommend you get a crown. Dental crowns are the most traditional way to protect or fix a broken or damaged tooth that’s beyond the help of a filling. Also called a cap, a crown covers the tooth’s surface and restores it to its natural shape and size.

      Although there are different types of dental crowns, from ceramic to metals like gold, porcelain crowns are the most common. With our dentists’ expert eye for detail, a porcelain crown blends in seamlessly with your natural teeth, and the metal restoration hidden underneath is extremely durable. With excellent dental care, your crown can last up to 25 to 30 years before it needs to be replaced. Dental crowns take two appointments to complete.

      During the first appointment, your crowns dentist will file down your tooth, removing any decay and damage before creating a mold of your tooth. This mold will be used to create a natural-looking crown that will perfectly fit your bite and tooth alignment. We’ll then set you up with a temporary crown to keep your tooth protected and sealed while your shiny, new crown is being made. Once your permanent crown is ready, the dentist will secure it to your tooth with a dental adhesive. We’ll make sure it fits correctly and that your bite feels just as natural as it ever was.

      If you have a damaged or broken tooth, a crown may be the answer for you. Give us a call today so that we can help restore your smile!

      When you have a tooth removed, you shouldn’t have to worry about hiding your smile. At Nu Dentistry, we’re experts when it comes to bringing new life to your smile with a dental bridge for a missing tooth. Bridges are a simple way to fill the gap between two teeth and have it look natural. Similar to a crown, a bridge is prepared by shaving down the neighboring teeth surrounding the gap and topping them, each with a porcelain cap. What sets bridges apart, however, is what’s sandwiched between the two caps: an artificial tooth.

      There are multiple advantages to getting a dental bridge. They can maintain your facial structure by securing teeth that are drifting into the space left behind by a missing tooth. They can also stabilize your bite, helping to restore your speech and eating to normal. Bridges can also replace multiple missing teeth, making it a great alternative option for partial dentures. Are you interested in strengthening your teeth and restoring your smile with dental bridges? Call our office today at (832) 916-4144 to get started!

    heading: DENTAL BRIDGE VS. IMPLANT
    text: WEIGHING THE PROS AND CONS OF YOUR NEW TEETH
    content: |-
      Dental bridges aren’t the only solution for replacing missing teeth. There’s also dental implants. What’s the difference and which one is better for your needs? Implants are a 3-part artificial tooth made of a metal post (or implant) screwed into the jawbone, a crown to act as the natural-looking tooth, and an abutment to attach the two. Implants don’t need any additional work done on neighboring teeth like a bridge does, but a bone graft may be required if the jaw isn’t strong enough to support the post.

      Implants are great for putting less strain on neighboring teeth and are easier to clean and maintain, but they’re much more costly than dental bridges. They’re also permanent, as they’ve been surgically implanted into the jaw and fused to the bone. Dental implants also take much longer to complete as the mouth needs more time to heal from such an intensive treatment. Another drawback of implants is that they can only replace one tooth at a time unless you’re planning to have what’s known as an All-on-4 implant procedure.

      This isn’t a problem with dental bridges, which can bridge the gap between as many as four or more extracted teeth at a time. To get the best of both worlds, our dentist may recommend you take a blended approach with implant-supported bridges. This option is especially popular for patients who’ve had multiple molars removed and don’t have an anchoring tooth on both ends to support a bridge. To speak with your dentist about which option is right for you, contact our office today at (832) 916-4144. today.

      - heading: HOW MUCH DOES A DENTAL CROWN COST?
        content:
          Depending on the materials used, the amount of prep work needed, and your level of dental insurance coverage, the cost of your crown can vary. If you’re concerned about the costs of your upcoming crown, you can call our office at (832) 916-4144 to discuss your financial options.
      - heading: HOW LONG DO CROWNS LAST?
        content:
          On average, porcelain crowns are sturdy and can last around 15 years. However, their longevity mostly depends on you and your oral hygiene. Patients with great dental hygiene habits can see their crowns live up to 25 to 30 years. Those who don’t brush and floss or attend dental cleaning appointments regularly may need to replace theirs in as little as 5.
      - heading: SHOULD I GET A CROWN OR EXTRACTION?
        content:
          At Nu Dentistry, our top priority is preserving your healthy, beautiful smile, and that includes saving as many of your natural teeth as we can. It is our firm belief that a tooth extraction should only be performed as a last resort. When the tooth is too damaged to be restored, or the tooth will cause further lasting damage to the health and structure of the rest of your mouth, an extraction is necessary. Natural teeth are more durable and less costly to upkeep than artificial replacements.
      - heading: WHY IS IT BLACK AROUND MY CROWN?
        content:
          For patients who use porcelain crowns with a metal inner restoration, you may find a black line around the bottom edge of your crown. While the porcelain perfectly matches the rest of your teeth, the metal restoration does not. If there’s a margin between the two or your gum line recedes, then the restoration becomes exposed and appears black. As long as you continue to maintain good oral hygiene habits, your tooth is perfectly healthy and thriving with its crown. 
      - heading: HOW MUCH DOES A DENTAL BRIDGE COST?
        content:
          "The cost of your dental bridge hinges on a number of important factors: the type of bridge, the materials used, the number of teeth to be replaced, and the location of the missing teeth. Implant-supported bridges, for example, tend to cost more than traditional bridges."
      - heading: HOW DOES A TOOTH BRIDGE WORK?
        content:
          A bridge for a missing tooth does just as its name suggests. It bridges the space left behind by a removed tooth by shaving down the teeth on both ends of the gap and capping them, each with a crown. These crowns are joined to the number of false teeth needed, so the entire device is a single piece. Altogether, the supporting crowns keep the replacement teeth both secure in place and strong enough to act similarly to your natural teeth.
