    heading: A Clear Path to Straight Teeth
    text: Invisalign in Bellflower is one of the best options available for straightening your teeth
    content: Invisalign is the latest cosmetic dentistry* technology in aligning your teeth. Unlike traditional braces, Invisalign in Bellflower has no metal, no wires, and is 100% removable. This option for aligning your teeth is made up of durable resin materials that are custom-molded into a set of almost completely invisible aligners. In order to use Invisalign properly, you must snap them onto your teeth and wear them as close to 24 hours a day as possible. Because these clear aligners are removable, you take them out to eat and brush your teeth, which helps reduce the oral hygiene** problems that could occur. The clear braces are swapped out twice a month for a new molded set to slowly tighten teeth into place. Take a look at our dental reviews to see how much our patients love braces in Bellflower and our team of dental professionals.

    heading: Is Invisalign For You?
    text: Invisalign in Bellflower may be the best treatment option for you, schedule a consultation to find out
    content:
      As long as you have a need for them, you can get Invisalign. There are some cases in which alignment may be too severe to use Invisalign as an alternative to traditional metal braces. However, anyone with fully-grown adult teeth is able to use clear aligners in Bellflower as an option for dental alignment. One of the appeals to those with fully-grown adult teeth is the lack of metal appearance in their mouth with Invisalign. Actually, clear braces are almost completely undetectable. Not to mention that they are also comfortable when compared to traditional metal braces. Invisalign is a great way for adults and professionals to correct their teeth while still feeling confident about their smile. If you would like to schedule an appointment to discuss what braces in Bellflower can do for you, call us. We are looking forward to hearing from you!

      - heading: What is Invisalign?
        content:
          DInvisalign is a type of orthodontic treatment that uses clear, removable aligners to straighten teeth. Unlike traditional braces, there are no metal brackets or wires visible on the surface of your teeth. Instead, Invisalign trays are made from smooth, comfortable, and virtually invisible plastic. 
      - heading: Why do I need an orthodontist?
        content:
          There are many reasons why you may need the help of an orthodontist. Orthodontics is a specialty that deals with correcting irregularities of the teeth and jaws, whether congenital or acquired. Whether you have crooked teeth, gaps between your teeth, underbite, or overbite - there's almost always something to fix! 
      - heading: What procedures do orthodontists do?
        content:
          Orthodontists are responsible for diagnosing and treating a variety of dental problems such as misaligned teeth, overbites, underbites, and overcrowding. They primarily use metal wires to straighten the teeth, but they may also place braces on the back teeth or attach ceramic appliances if necessary. Orthodontists work with patients from children to adults and often provide consultations for those who need extensive treatment like jaw surgery.
      - heading: Do clear aligners really work?
        content:
          Clear aligners are often considered the most effective way to get teeth straightened without braces because they are removable. They also don't limit your ability to eat or drink anything that may stain your teeth. On the other hand, they require extra effort on the part of the wearer in order to keep moving their teeth into place by wearing them constantly.
      - heading: What is fixed orthodontic treatment?
        content:
          Fixed orthodontic treatment is a type of treatment that can be done on patients with malocclusion or an alignment problem. It's also perfect for those who need to improve their oral health and hygiene. 
      - heading: What are lingual braces? 
        content:
          Lingual braces are a type of orthodontic treatment that uses brackets and wires placed on the inside of your teeth. They're called "invisible" because they can't be seen from the outside of your mouth.
      - heading: What does Invisalign do? 
        content:
          Invisalign is a type of orthodontic treatment that straightens your teeth without the use of traditional metal braces. Invisalign uses a series of clear, removable aligners to correct your smile. Each set of aligners can be worn for about two weeks. The material used in each aligner is very similar to what dentists use during impressions, and it molds perfectly with the shape of your teeth so they will not slip out or fall off while you are wearing them. 
      - heading: What is headgear?
        content:
          Dental headgear is a device that helps to correct a protruding jaw or an underdeveloped mandible. This device also helps to close the open bite by using pressure against your teeth. 
      - heading: Can braces correct an overbite? 
        content:
          Dental braces are used to correct the alignment of teeth in your mouth so they fit together properly. The metal bands that hold the brackets on either side of the tooth can be uncomfortable and may take time to get used to. You'll also need ongoing dental care for your teeth while wearing braces with regular checkups and cleanings - which is something you will want to factor into your budget when deciding if wearing braces is right for you.
