    heading: It’s Time For a Visit When…
    text: We recommend visiting the children’s dentist in Bellflower at a certain time for the best dental results
    content: According to recent dental studies, parents believe it's time for the first dental visit* around age 3, however, earlier may be even better. Our children’s dentist in Bellflower recommends bringing your child to the office around the age of 1, or around 6 months after the first tooth is visible. A child’s primary teeth begin to grow at 6 months of age, and it is important to begin healthy dental habits early. If you are able to establish visits to the dentist regularly and teach proper brushing and flossing techniques, your child is less likely to have dental problems like tooth decay** as they get older. This will also help your child experience comfort in going to the dentist so that they do not develop dental fears or anxiety if faced with their first experience at the dentist later on. Schedule an appointment with our children’s dentist in Bellflower at Bellflower Dental Group and let us help give them the dental care they need.

    heading: When Your Child is Scared of the Dentist…
    text: Learn how we suggest to help your kid’s experience with our children’s dentist in Bellflower
    content:
      At Bellflower Dental Group, we have several techniques we use to help calm the nerves of a young and anxious patient. We offer toys, music, movies, books, and more to help your child feel relaxed while they are in the dental chair. We know how hard it can be to convince your children there is nothing to fear, so we make sure they have a fun and comfortable experience each and every time they visit. However, a lot of the efforts to help with the jitters are things that can be done at home. For example, if you introduce your child to the kid’s dentist in Bellflower early on, they can form positive thoughts without fear from the very beginning. Children who visit the dentist later on often have apprehension about their treatments. You can also help by using materials that are fun to educate your children on proper dental care. Another idea is to dive into your child’s imagination and act as a dentist and patient while playing to show your child there is nothing to be scared of. If you have any questions about how you can help your child with anxiety when visiting your children’s dentist in Bellflower, we are available 24/7. Call us, and we will be more than happy to help!

    faqs:
      - heading: What is comfort dentistry?
        content:
          Comfort dentistry is a dental specialty that focuses on the patient's comfort through the entire dental appointment. The dentist will make sure to provide an environment where patients are able to relax and feel comfortable while they work with their teeth, gums, and jaws.
      - heading: What happens at your child's first dental visit?
        content:
          Your child's first dental visit is a milestone. At this appointment, the dentist will usually check the development of your child's baby teeth and gums. They'll also clean their teeth with an antibacterial solution so that they can grow into healthy adult ones! Unless there is a need for a children's emergency dentist, your child will always love their visit to the dentist office for kids. 
      - heading: How do I prepare my child for the dentist?
        content:
          Your child will need to brush their teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste. Make sure they use the proper amount of toothpaste and speak with your dentist about what type would be best for them. You should also make sure they drink plenty of water and avoid sugary drinks and snacks that can lead to cavities.
      - heading: Does my child need a pediatric dentist?
        content:
          Once children reach the age of three, they can go to a kid friendly dentist every six months or once per year if their parents prefer to hold off on another visit so soon after the last one. 
      - heading: What is the age for orthodontic treatment?
        content:
          The most common age for orthodontic treatment is typically between 12 and 14 years old. This seems to be the time when kids are entering puberty, and their bodies are rapidly changing. 
      - heading: Do pediatric dentists do surgery?
        content:
          A pediatric dentist can perform surgeries on children if they have extensive experience in performing these types of procedures. It's important to note that not all dentists for kids are able to do this type of work because it requires special training and skills.
