    heading: Knowing When to Whiten
    text: Professional teeth whitening in Bellflower is handled best when you know the time to do it
    content: When you are first considering treatment for dental bleaching, your whitening treatments can be done at any time. However, if you plan on getting teeth bleaching treatments done periodically, there is a time frame you should stick to in order to keep your teeth and their enamel strong and healthy. At Bellflower Dental Group, we recommend waiting six months after a professional whitening treatment is complete before getting another. Bleaching your teeth can add sensitivity you may not want if done too often, and it can also cause damage. If you are only seeing darker spots on a tooth or a few teeth, there are spot treatments available, which help when considering damage to other teeth that may not need treatment. If you are really concerned with the yellowing appearance of your teeth once they are whitened, staying away from foods, beverages, and other items such as tobacco that have a coloring effect on your teeth is a good idea. Schedule an appointment for your professional teeth whitening in Bellflower today, and start feeling more confident in your smile.

    heading: "Dental Bleaching: Choosing a Solution For You"
    text: Professional teeth whitening in Bellflower might be the best option for your bleaching efforts
    content:
      When you are considering dental bleaching, there are three routes you can take, two of which are professional whitening products that are proven safe and effective. The first is in-office bleaching, which uses a higher concentration of chemicals to aid in faster results. The best part about this option is that it is affordable and under the care of a dental professional. Next, also a professional teeth whitening option, are take-home whitening trays. At our office in Bellflower, we offer take-home trays, which are custom-made and molded to fit your teeth. These trays are then sent home with you, along with a powerful whitening agent. At-home whitening trays are very affordable, and they are also convenient. These trays allow you to whiten when you like until you reach your desired color. The only drawback when compared to in-office bleaching is the lack of instant results. Results with trays will appear over a span of time. Lastly, you have over-the-counter products to use for your whitening needs. When it comes to these types of products, there are many on the market, and some are not as safe as others. We advise you to consult with a dental professional about the use of store-bought whitening products, and also to see if this is a good idea to use on your teeth. If you would like to discuss your options for dental bleaching in Bellflower more thoroughly, schedule an appointment with our cosmetic dentist* for an examination.

    faqs:
      - heading: What causes teeth stains?
        content:
          The natural build-up of plaque and bacteria on your teeth is the main cause for stains. The color of these stains depends on what you eat and drink. Some foods like coffee, tea, wine, berries, and carrots can stain your teeth a deep brown or black color, while others such as beets or turmeric can make them yellow. You may also notice that some people's teeth naturally darken over time due to their diet choices. 
      - heading: How do dentists whiten teeth?
        content:
          Dentists have a variety of options for whitening teeth in the office. Some dentists use LED light to bleach stains, while others use a peroxide gel that is activated by the UV light from the dentist's machine. A third option some offices offer is laser bleaching.
      - heading: Does whitening remove stains?
        content:
          Teeth whitening is a process that can remove surface stains and lighten teeth. It does not, however, remove the dark staining within tooth enamel itself. That will require professional dental treatment by your dentist or periodontist.
      - heading: How do I prepare my teeth for whitening?
        content:
          In order to properly prepare for your teeth whitening experience, you must make sure they are free of cavities or decay*. Whiteners will only work on healthy teeth; if there are cavities present, they can become worse when exposed to harsh chemicals, like hydrogen peroxide, which causes them to spread further through the tooth structure, weakening bone support and leaving behind more room for future infection.
      - heading: How long do your teeth stay white after whitening?
        content:
          There are a number of factors that can affect how long your teeth stay white after you whiten them. From the type of toothpaste and mouthwash you use to what kind of food or drink you consume, there is plenty that affects the longevity of your pearly whites. The longevity of your teeth whitening will depend on how you take care of your teeth. 
      - heading: Is laser teeth whitening safe?
        content:
          Laser teeth whitening is a procedure where the dentist takes a laser and uses it to change the color of your teeth. While this may sound scary, there are actually very few risks associated with this process. The only risk you should be worried about is if you have certain medical conditions that prevent you from having safe dental work done.
      - heading: Does teeth whitening hurt? 
        content:
          The process of teeth whitening is not painful because no topical materials are used. The most common side effects are tooth sensitivity and dry mouth, both of which subside within a few days.
      - heading: Is professional teeth whitening for everyone?
        content:
          Teeth whitening is becoming more and more popular. The cosmetic procedure has been featured on television shows, in movies, and on the covers of magazines. Celebrities are seen with their pearly whites glowing after getting a touch-up at the dentist's office or having an at-home teeth whitening kit. More people are interested in white teeth than ever before because they want to look their best for photo opportunities or special occasions, like weddings and graduations.
      - heading: Is teeth whitening safe for children?
        content:
          Getting your teeth whitened is one of the best ways to improve your smile. However, it may not be safe for everyone, so you need to make sure it's right for you before you begin treatment. Bleaching treatments should never be given to children under 18, since they can damage their growing teeth and make them discolored.
