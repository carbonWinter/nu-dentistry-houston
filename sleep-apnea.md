    heading: Snoring is a Warning Sign
    text: Snoring in Bellflower may be a sign you have sleep apnea, and our team at Bellflower Dental Group is here to help
    content: Snoring is one of the most obvious signs that you are having trouble with airflow during your sleep. So how could this be a sign of sleep apnea? Sleep apnea in Bellflower is a disorder that causes you to have restricted or irregular breathing while you are asleep. However, just because you are snoring doesnâ€™t mean you have the condition. There are other factors that contribute to the likelihood of you having sleep apnea, which can be genetic. For example, it is most common in men who smoke, are overweight, and are over the age of sixty. Even though it is more common in men, it is possible for anyone to experience sleep apnea, including young children*. Check out our reviews, and see what our patients are saying about their treatment.

    heading: What Are The Symptoms?
    text: Sleep apnea in Bellflower has quite a few symptoms you may want to take a look at
    content:
      Do you have problems sleeping comfortably at night? How about trouble sleeping coupled with snoring or dry throat? These are a few signs that show it is possible you have sleep apnea. If you have problems sleeping, there is often a reason why, and knowing for sure if you have sleep apnea requires a visit to a professional. When living with sleep apnea in Bellflower, choking, gasping for air, daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, and sore throat are all symptoms of the disorder. It is a very serious condition that, if left untreated, can have adverse effects on your body. Some health conditions associated with snoring and sleep apnea include high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, depression, and even heart failure. However, if you think you or someone you know may be suffering from this sleep disorder, there are several ways our team at Bellflower Dental Group* can help. One of your options is a C-PAP, or continuous positive airway pressure, which is a device that uses air pressure to help the flow of your breathing. This device is very effective, but many patients prefer our C-PAP alternative in Bellflower because it is a smaller dental appliance. Fortunately, whichever device you choose, your airway will open up and you will see significant improvements in your ability to sleep at night. You will also feel better during the day. If you are interested in our dental appliance, a C-PAP alternative in Bellflower, call us to see one of our dental professionals for your consultation.

    faqs:
      - heading: Why is sleep apnea bad?
        content:
          Sleep apnea can cause many different problems with your health, but most importantly, it can lead to high blood pressure or stroke because of lack of oxygen to the brain during the night. 
      - heading: Who suffers from sleep apnea?
        content:
          It is estimated that 1 in 4 people suffer from sleep apnea, and the number of people with the disorder is on the rise. Sleep apnea affects men more than women, but anyone can be at risk for this condition if they are overweight or obese. 
      - heading: What causes sleep apnea?
        content:
          Sleep apnea can be caused by an obstruction in your airway during sleep, which leads to shallow breathing and interrupted sleep.
      - heading: What are the warning signs of sleep apnea?
        content:
          If you are not feeling refreshed after a night's sleep, or if you have trouble breathing when sleeping, then there may be a case of sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a condition where the patient has pauses in their breathing during sleep. This can lead to chronic fatigue and daytime drowsiness.
      - heading: What does sleep apnea sound like?
        content:
          Snoring, gasping for air, and choking sounds are all signs of sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a serious condition that can lead to high blood pressure, obesity, depression, memory loss, and more. 
      - heading: Can you test yourself for sleep apnea?
        content:
          Sleep apnea happens when there are breaks in breathing during the night. These breaks can last from seconds to minutes with each one resulting in temporary oxygen deprivation. A sleep study or polysomnography is the best way to find out if someone has sleep apnea.
      - heading: How do they diagnose sleep apnea?
        content:
          A dentist will use sensitive equipment including microphones and video cameras in order to identify any disruptions in breathing patterns throughout the night while patients are sleeping.
      - heading: Is sleep apnea a progressive disease?
        content:
          Sleep apnea can affect you in a number of different ways, including fatigue, obesity, and even an increased risk for heart attack and stroke. It can also lead to memory problems as well as chronic depression which could lead to suicidal thoughts if left untreated for too long.
      - heading: How can I improve my sleep apnea without CPAP?
        content:
          CPAP machines use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This can help open up your airway by blowing just enough extra oxygen into the back of your throat so that it does not collapse while sleeping. It is important to remember that this device will only work if used correctly and consistently.
