    content: |-
      Maintaining healthy teeth and gums is essential to both your smile and your overall health, but here at Nu Dentistry, we know it’s almost impossible to do it alone. That’s why we recommend you visit our office for general dental cleanings and exams every 3, 4, or 6 months, depending on your dental history.

      We’ve seen from experience that just brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing can’t stop bacteria and plaque from building up. If left alone too long, this can lead to painful and costly problems like cavities, bleeding gums, gum disease, and even tooth loss!

      We want to protect your beautiful smile, and the best way to do so is through prevention and early detection. We’re not just focused on reacting to ongoing emergencies but on making sure they’re never needed.

      If problems do arise, we’re ready to catch them during dental exams when they first appear and treat them before they become bigger headaches. Frequent dental cleanings and exams not only ensure optimal future dental health, but also saves you money in the long run.

      If you’re ready for your next dental cleaning and exam appointment, click here or call our office at (832) 916-4144 to schedule yours today!

    heading: WHAT IS A DEEP CLEANING?
    text: WE ENSURE YOUR SMILE STAYS INTACT WITH DEEP CLEANINGS.
    content: |-
      When performing your general cleaning, your hygienist might decide that you may need a deep cleaning as well. A deep cleaning is a treatment that, just like with your general cleaning, will clear your teeth of hardened plaque and tartar, only it’ll go a little deeper—into your gums and down to the bottom of your roots. There’s no surgery or invasive treatment involved. Completing your treatment may take several visits. We want to be as thorough as possible, making sure that your gums are fully free from plaque buildup. But you may be wondering, is it really as important as your dentist says? The answer is, YES!

      Deep cleanings aren’t something you should put off because they’re essential to prevent and treat periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is a more severe form of gingivitis that happens when plaque and tartar spread under your gums, causing infection and inflammation. At its worst, it can cause teeth to loosen or fall out, which is both a patient’s and dentist’s worst nightmare! Nearly half of all adults over the age of 30 have some form of gum disease, and that number only goes up with age. If you notice your gums bleeding when you floss, contact your dentist right away because you may have periodontal disease.

          The use of an electric toothbrush is one of the best ways to ensure that
          you are brushing your teeth thoroughly. The high-speed rotation allows for a
          more thorough scrubbing, which can help to remove plaque and bacteria from areas
          that may be hard to clean with a regular manual brush. This can reduce your
          risk of developing gum disease or cavities in the future.

          Water helps to flush out the harmful bacteria and plaque buildup in your

          you've eaten, especially sugary foods. It also keeps your saliva production
          strong - an important factor in protecting teeth from cavities since saliva
          naturally washes away acids formed by cavity-causing bacteria. So drink up!

      - heading: IS LASER DENTAL CLEANING BETTER?
        content:
          Laser dental cleaning works just as well as traditional tools but without all the traditional loud and pointy tools you don’t like. They’re the least invasive form of teeth cleaning, and there’s less of a chance for bleeding or inflammation to occur. If you prefer your hygienist work with lasers, let us know and we’ll be happy to accommodate you.
      - heading: HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU GET A DEEP CLEANING?
        content:
          You should get a deep cleaning as often as your dentist recommends. Because it can only treat, not cure gum disease, regular cleanings are necessary to properly maintain and contain your periodontal disease. Otherwise the infection can spread to cause bone and tooth loss.
      - heading: IS IT PAINFUL TO GET A DEEP CLEANING AT THE DENTIST?
        content:
          Because deep cleanings go further than your normal teeth cleaning, it can be slightly uncomfortable. However, we pride ourselves on our gentle dental care. To make sure you’re never less than completely at ease, we’ll prepare you with an anesthetic that will numb your gums and make the entire process painless. If you’re nervous, we can administer a light sedation like laughing gas that will keep both your mind and body relaxed.
      - heading: DOES ORAL HEALTH AFFECT OVERALL HEALTH?
        content:
          Oral health does affect your overall health! Not only can early symptoms of diseases like diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis first start in your mouth, but bad oral hygiene has been linked to causing heart disease, strokes, pneumonia, and complications during pregnancy.     
      - heading: ARE THERE ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE SERVICES I CAN ASK FOR DURING MY CLEANING?
        content:
          Our office always wants to make sure your visits are as convenient and productive as possible. As part of your cleaning, you can request optional services such as laser cleanings or teeth whitening to further protect and improve your smile.
      - heading: DOES DENTAL CLEANING LOOSEN TEETH?
        content:
          No. Even with a deep cleaning, you can rest assured that your teeth will stay safely rooted to your mouth. It only cleans your teeth of plaque and tartar below the gum line. However, periodontal disease, which deep cleanings help prevent, can cause tooth decay that’s severe enough to loosen your teeth or, worse, fall out!
