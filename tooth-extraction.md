    heading: PAINLESS TOOTH EXTRACTION IN HOUSTON IS POSSIBLE!
    text: NU DENTISTRY MAKES YOUR EMERGENCY TOOTH REMOVAL A BREEZE.
    content: |-
      When you have severe tooth pain, it can be a real dental emergency—and Nu Dentistry is here to help you through them all, including teeth extraction. While it may sound scary, our friendly, gentle dentists make sure you’re always relaxed in our office. There are 2 main types of tooth removal procedures:

      Simple extraction. A simple extraction is used to remove teeth that are visible. Once local anesthetic has properly numbed the area, your dentist will use a tool called an elevator to loosen your tooth and forceps to fully remove it from your gum.

      Surgical extraction. A surgical extraction is instead performed on teeth that are not visible, like fully submerged teeth or teeth that have broken off below the gumline. Our on-site oral surgeon will make an incision and extract your tooth directly from your gums. Since this method is more intensive, the surgeon will most likely give you a mix of local anesthetic and sedation, including oral or IV sedation. This ensures both your body and mind are relaxed and comfortable throughout your treatment.

      After your treatment, we’ll prepare you with aftercare instructions to ensure that your mouth stays healthy and heals quickly without any complications. Within a week or two of your procedure, new bone and gum tissue will fill the gap your tooth left behind.

      At Nu Dentistry, we understand that you can’t always plan when you have a toothache or when your molars are coming in. That’s why if you need emergency tooth extraction, we’re on-call and ready for you. We do our best to ensure you’re in our patient suites within minutes of your arrival.

      If you need to call our on-site staff to schedule an immediate appointment, call us now at (832) 916-4144.

    text: LET US HELP YOU PRESERVE YOUR SMILE AFTER YOUR EXTRACTION.
    copy: |- 
      After your tooth has been fully extracted, it's crucial to choose the replacement that works best for you. Leaving a missing tooth alone for too long can lead to serious complications to your dental health and shorten the longevity of your smile.

      These are the most common tooth replacement options:

    - heading: DENTAL IMPLANTS
      copy: |-
        **Dental implants** are a great option! They consist of 3 main parts: an implant, a crown, and an abutment. The implant is a metal post that is surgically attached and fused to the jawbone, acting as an artificial root for the replacement tooth. The crown is what we think of as the "tooth" portion. It feels and functions like a normal tooth, but is often made of sturdy porcelain. The abutment is the connector between the implant and crown, keeping the whole piece together like glue. Implants are a bit costly, but they last a long time, are easy to maintain and clean and preserve the bone in your jaw.

    - heading: FIXED BRIDGE
      copy: 
        For dental bridges, the dentist shaves down the two teeth surrounding the gap of a missing tooth and caps them with a crown. They're attached to a false replacement tooth to act as a bridge between them, keeping the teeth from shifting into the open space. Bridges are an especially good choice for people who have had more than one tooth removed in the same area, as they can replace more than four teeth at a time if necessary. Bridges, however, can put a strain on the healthy capped teeth, so dental implants are superior to this more affordable option.

      copy: 
        As the name suggests, these dentures are used to replace some missing teeth rather than all of them. The replacements are connected to a pink base that fits perfectly between your natural teeth. Some have clasps that can attach to the teeth surrounding the gap for extra security. The whole piece is completely removable, making it easy to clean.

    heading: WISDOM TOOTH REMOVAL
    text: WE PUT YOUR LONG-TERM DENTAL HEALTH FIRST.
    content: |-
      Wisdom teeth extractions might seem drastic and terrifying to patients, but they are exceedingly common. In fact, over 10 million Americans have successfully had their wisdom teeth removed at some point in their lives. Not all wisdom teeth need to be extracted. However, studies have shown that up to 85% of all teens and adults need at least one wisdom tooth removed.

      Reasons why wisdom teeth may need to be extracted:

      - **Tooth direction.** Sometimes a wisdom tooth will emerge sideways or tilted from the gum.
      - **Impaction.** Wisdom teeth that are unable to fully emerge from the gum can lead to infection or tooth decay. In worst-case scenarios, they can cause severe gum disease, cysts, and tumors.
      - **Crowded and crooked teeth.** An incoming wisdom tooth can seriously damage nearby teeth and disrupt the alignment of your arch. This crowding can lead to the need for braces or other costly procedures that could otherwise have been avoided.
      - **Too little space.** If there's not enough room for a wisdom tooth to erupt, it can lead to partial eruption as well as infection and decay.
      - **Pain.** Toothaches and pain are never a good sign, and depending on your specific case can lead to multiple immediate and future problems.
      - **Orthodontic problems.** For teens and adults with braces or clear aligners like Invisalign, incoming wisdom teeth can be a nightmare. They run the risk of losing those patients all of their hard-earned straightening progress, setting them back to square one—or worse.

      If you have any questions or concerns about a possible wisdom tooth removal for you or your child, call our office at (832) 916-4144 to set up a consultation.

      - heading: WHAT IS TOOTH EXTRACTION?
        content:
          Tooth extraction is a dental procedure in which your dentist removes a tooth from your mouth. Extractions may be needed for many reasons. Your tooth is damaged beyond repair. The tooth is unable to emerge from your gums. Or the tooth may be impacted, and its emerging will disrupt your teeth's alignment, requiring costly and time-consuming dental work to **straighten your teeth**.
      - heading: WHEN SHOULD A TOOTH BE REMOVED?
        content:
          A tooth should be removed only when it poses a threat to the health of the rest of your mouth. Nu Dentistry is dedicated to saving and restoring as many of your teeth as possible! However, saving a tooth may not always be possible when it comes to severely infected, impacted, and crowded teeth. If it's possible to repair your tooth without extraction, then we recommend you always choose this less drastic treatment, if possible.
      - heading: DOES TOOTH EXTRACTION HURT?
        content:
          Thanks to modern-day anesthesia, even surgical tooth extraction can be completely painless! Local anesthesia thoroughly numbs the tooth and surrounding area, so you're always comfortable during your extraction. If you're at all anxious about your treatment, we offer a number of safe sedation options to help ease your mind as well as your body.
      - heading: WHAT DOES A TOOTH EXTRACTION COST?
        content:
          Depending on the location of the tooth, the type of extraction ( simple or surgical) done, and what method of anesthesia or sedation will be used, the price for your tooth removal may vary. Wisdom tooth removals, for example, have their price separate from standard surgical extractions.       
      - heading: IS IT OK NOT TO REPLACE A MISSING TOOTH?
        content:
          It's dentist-recommended that you replace your removed tooth to save yourself a lot of potential pain and money in the future. Missing teeth not only lead to bone and structural deterioration, but your surrounding teeth will shift to fill the gaps. Those teeth often become at risk of gum disease, which can lead to them falling out or needing extraction as well. Replacement teeth help maintain the structure and integrity of your mouth, far extending the lifespan of your smile.
      - heading: IS IT REALLY NECESSARY TO REMOVE IMPACTED WISDOM TEETH?
        content:
          While not always necessary for everyone, impacted wisdom tooth extraction can be extremely crucial in a patient's dental development and overall health. If wisdom teeth are unable to fully emerge, you can't properly clean or maintain them. Tooth decay and gum disease are often quick to follow. In some instances, this can lead to cysts and tumor development. At Nu Dentistry, we only recommend that at-risk teeth be removed, and we take great care to ensure you always retain your healthiest smile possible.
