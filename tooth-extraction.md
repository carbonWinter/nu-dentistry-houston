    heading: Why Pull a Tooth?
    text: A tooth extraction in Bellflower isn’t always necessary, and our staff will do everything they can to save your tooth
    content: When contemplating getting a tooth pulled, it is important to know our dental professionals will never pull a tooth unless it is necessary. We will try to save your tooth before using a tooth extraction in Bellflower as an option. However, with certain patients' cases, an extraction could be the best option available. Many patients have progressive tooth decay* or a significant injury to the tooth, which may make it difficult to save. In that case, we will discuss your options for tooth replacement. Sometimes people often volunteer to have teeth pulled for various reasons as well. Check out our dental reviews and see what our patients are saying about their tooth extraction in Bellflower at Bellflower Dental Group.

    heading: Tooth Replacement and Your Options
    text: Tooth extraction in Bellflower has several options for replacements
    content:
      "If you have a missing tooth or have a tooth pulled, it is a good idea to consider replacing the missing or extracted tooth for full function of your bite. When considering tooth replacement, there are three common options: implants*, bridges, and dentures. Implants provide you with a stable and strong tooth replacement that acts like a normal tooth. It is even connected to the jawbone. Bridges are another choice for replacement of your extracted teeth. However, with the technology of implants, bridges are becoming less popular. This is because bridges can often put other teeth in danger, as the adjacent teeth to your missing tooth are used for support. Dentures are another option that many clients choose, especially when they have several extracted teeth. When many hear of dentures as a treatment option, they assume all of your teeth must be missing. However, that is not the case. We have partial as well as complete denture options available at Bellflower Dental Group. This means you can get dentures for only a portion of your teeth! If you have any questions about tooth extraction in Bellflower or the options for tooth replacement, please give us a call."

    faqs:
      - heading: What happens when a tooth is pulled?
        content:
          The dentist will numb the area with an anesthetic, then use an elevator to help get the tooth out, along with a pair of pliers. The condition of the tooth will play a part in if they take the tooth out in one piece or several pieces.
      - heading: Does a tooth extraction hurt?
        content:
          It's a common misconception that dental extractions hurt. In reality, it is one of the most painless procedures we perform, and patients often report feeling relieved when their tooth is removed. The only time an extraction may be uncomfortable is if you have severe gum disease or decay in your mouth which requires a root canal treatment before extracting the tooth. For many people, wisdom tooth removal and other types of teeth extraction can relieve significant discomfort associated with teeth grinding, jaw pain, or headaches caused by sinus pressure from crowding teeth or impacted wisdom teeth. 
      - heading: How do I know if my tooth extraction is healing properly?
        content:
          If you are experiencing pain, swelling, or have difficulty chewing on the side of your mouth where your tooth was extracted, it’s time to contact your dentist. These symptoms may indicate that you have an infection and need treatment. It is important to pay attention to these warning signs so that they don’t become more serious issues in the future. 
      - heading: Is tooth extraction necessary?
        content:
          One of the most common reasons for extraction is because the tooth has been severely decayed or broken down, and your dentist cannot fix it with a filling. Other times there might be too little bone left around the tooth to hold on to it, so removing it will prevent further problems and pain in that area. Emergency tooth extractions also take place if necessary. 
      - heading: What is the best option for replacing missing teeth?
        content:
          There are a few options that you can explore when it comes to replacing missing teeth. The most common option is a dental implant, however, dentures and bridges may also be appropriate. It's important to discuss your personal goals with your dentist so they can recommend the best option for you.
      - heading: How long does it take to get a tooth pulled?
        content:
          The average time it takes to get a tooth pulled is 1 to 2 hours. Some people will want to have anesthesia for the procedure, they can be sedated with nitrous oxide or put under general anesthesia. The dentist may provide you with an antibiotic and pain medication before, during, and after your dental procedure.
      - heading: What does tooth extraction cost?
        content:
          Tooth extraction cost can vary depending on what type of teeth are extracted, how many teeth need to be pulled, their location, and whether or not you have dental insurance. This also includes the dentist fee and any medication that may be needed after the procedure.
      - heading: How common is tooth extraction?
        content:
          The American Dental Association (ADA) estimates that as many as 10% of adults over the age of 35 will need an extraction in their lifetime. 
      - heading: Can I drink water after tooth extraction?
        content:
          It's not recommended that you drink any liquids other than water for 24 hours after surgery because it could introduce bacteria into your mouth and lead to infection. Some dentists believe that drinking water immediately following an oral surgery can actually help with healing by rinsing food particles away from the surgical site and reducing swelling in the area.
